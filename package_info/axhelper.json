{"description": "ActiveXHelper is a small utility that allows you to view essential information about ActiveX components installed on your computer.\n\nYou can view the entire (and very large !) list of ActiveX components by loading it from `HKLR:\\CLSID` Registry key, or alternatively, display only the ActiveX components that you specify.\n\nIn addition, you can temporarily disable specific ActiveX components. When ActiveX components are disabled, they cannot be used by any software, until you enable them again.", "updated": "2024-03-21T14:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/axhelper/1.12", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/axhelper/1.12", "licenseUrl": "http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/axhelper.html", "packageName": "axhelper", "displayName": "ActiveXHelper", "summary": "View/Enable/Disable ActiveX Components", "version": "1.12", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/2697586f564894b3346352497da46f320a02e725/icons/axhelper.png", "author": "Nir Sofer", "downloadCount": 1186, "tags": ["activex", "info"]}
