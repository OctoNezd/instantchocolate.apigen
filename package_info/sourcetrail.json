{"description": "Sourcetrail is an interactive source explorer that simplifies navigation in existing source code. Sourcetrail's aim is to give answers to all your questions about your source code. Sourcetrail first indexes your code and gathers data about its structure and then provides you a simple interface consisting of three interactive views, each playing a key role in getting information:\nSearch: Use the search field to quickly find and select indexed symbols in your source code. The autocompletion box will instantly provide an overview of all matching results throughout your codebase.\nGraph: The graph displays the structure of your source code. It focuses on the currently selected symbol and directly shows all incoming and outgoing dependencies to other symbols.\nCode: The Code view displays all source locations of the currently selected symbol in a list of code snippets. Clicking on a different source location allows you to change the selection and dig deeper.\nSourcetrail currently supports the languages C/C++ and Java. Much of the UI design is therefore based on these languages and might change as soon as other languages are supported. For more information have a look at supported languages.", "updated": "2024-03-23T02:33:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sourcetrail/2021.4.19", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/sourcetrail/2021.4.19", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoatiSoftware/Sourcetrail/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "sourcetrail", "displayName": "Sourcetrail", "summary": "Sourcetrail is a free and open-source cross-platform source explorer that helps you get productive on unfamiliar source code.", "version": "2021.4.19", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/CoatiSoftware/Sourcetrail/ceb900589ec52587f5861c86fb0c9fc574cc9406/docs/documentation/img/logo.png", "author": "CoatiSoftware", "downloadCount": 5054, "tags": ["vcs", "git", "sourcetrail"]}
