{"description": "Badaboom is a blazingly fast media converter that makes it easy to format video files for a variety of devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Android phones and PSP, in a process called transcoding. In what used to take several hours, Badaboom converts feature-length movies to mobile profiles in a matter of minutes while still maintaining high video quality. By harnessing the power of NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPUs, Badaboom offloads the CPU to allow users to continue browsing the Internet or checking email without decreased system performance, making transcoding high-quality video fast and easy. Badaboom is now hardware-accelerated with the latest NVIDIA GPUs. It is also functional in CPU-only mode for systems that don\u2019t have an NVIDIA GPU.", "updated": "2024-03-12T16:49:00Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/badaboom-media-converter/2.0.0.128", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/badaboom-media-converter/2.0.0.128", "licenseUrl": "https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/legal-info/", "packageName": "badaboom-media-converter", "displayName": "Badaboom Media Converter (Install)", "summary": "Optimized for NVIDIA CUDA, Elemental Technologies Badaboom Media Converter allows aspiring filmmakers to transcode video and movies quickly and efficiently.", "version": "2.0.0.128", "icon": "https://www.geforce.com/sites/default/files-world/boxshot/pc-applications/BoxShot-badaboom-media-converter.jpg", "author": "Elemental Technologies Inc.", "downloadCount": 832, "tags": ["elemental", "technologies", "badaboom", "media", "converter", "nvidia", "cuda", "admin"]}
