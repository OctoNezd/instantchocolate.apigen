{"description": "The latest Cumulative Update (CU) download is the most recent CU released for SQL Server 2019 and contains all updates released since the release of SQL Server 2019 RTM.\n\n- Each new CU contains all the fixes that were included in the previous CU for the installed version of SQL Server.\n- SQL Server CUs are certified to the same levels as Service Packs, and should be installed at the same level of confidence.\n- Microsoft recommends ongoing, proactive installation of CUs as they become available:\n  - Historical data shows that a significant number of support cases involve an issue that has already been addressed in a released CU.\n  - CUs may contain added value over and above hotfixes. This includes supportability, manageability, and reliability updates.\n- We recommend that you test CUs before you deploy them to production environments.\n\n#### Supported Operating System\n\nWindows 10, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019\n\n#### Uninstalling\nUninstalling with Chocolatey is known to not be reliable, as the uninstaller wants to locate `sql_engine_core_inst_loc.msi` from the original installation media.\n\nShould you need to uninstall this cumulative update, you may need to revert to manual uninstallation via Programs and Features, Installed Updates.\n\n### Package Specific\n\n#### Package Parameters\n\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n * `/IgnorePendingReboot` - don't check for pending reboot (*Warning, SQL Server installations may fail if reboots are pending*)\n\n To pass parameters, use `--params \"''\"` (e.g. `choco install sql-server-2019-cumulative-update [other options] --params=\"'/ITEM:value /ITEM2:value2'\"`).\n\nExample using /IgnorePendingReboot\n\n```\nchoco install sql-server-2019-cumulative-update --params=\"'/IgnorePendingReboot'\"\n```", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:48:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sql-server-2019-cumulative-update/15.0.4355.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/sql-server-2019-cumulative-update/15.0.4355.3", "licenseUrl": "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019-pricing", "packageName": "sql-server-2019-cumulative-update", "displayName": "Microsoft SQL Server 2019 Cumulative Update 25", "summary": "The latest Cumulative Update (CU) download is the most recent CU released for SQL Server 2019", "version": "15.0.4355.3", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ferventcoder/chocolatey-packages/59ad5e2e32c52fd2a45a9735f95a81368f9e5e85/icons/microsoft-sql-server.svg", "author": "Microsoft Corporation", "downloadCount": 138537, "tags": ["SQL", "Server", "Cumulative", "Update", "2019"]}
