This includes supportability, manageability, and reliability updates.\n- We recommend that you test CUs before you deploy them to production environments.\n\n#### Uninstalling\nUninstalling with Chocolatey is known to not be reliable, as the uninstaller wants to locate `sql_engine_core_inst_loc.msi` from the original installation media.\n\nShould you need to uninstall this cumulative update, you may need to revert to manual uninstallation via Programs and Features, Installed Updates.", "updated": "2024-03-23T18:48:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sql-server-2017-cumulative-update/14.0.3456.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/sql-server-2017-cumulative-update/14.0.3456.2", "licenseUrl": "https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/sql-server/sql-server-2017-pricing", "packageName": "sql-server-2017-cumulative-update", "displayName": "Microsoft SQL Server 2017 Cumulative Update 31", "summary": "The latest Cumulative Update (CU) download is the most recent CU released for SQL Server 2017", "version": "14.0.3456.2", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ferventcoder/chocolatey-packages/59ad5e2e32c52fd2a45a9735f95a81368f9e5e85/icons/microsoft-sql-server.svg", "author": "Microsoft Corporation", "downloadCount": 72147, "tags": ["SQL", "Server", "Cumulative", "Update", "2017"]}
