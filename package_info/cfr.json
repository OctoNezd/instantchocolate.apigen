{"description": "CFR is a command-line tool to decopile Java code from class files or Jar files. CFR will decompile modern Java features - Java 8 lambdas (pre and post Java beta 103 changes), Java 7 String switches etc, but is written entirely in Java 6.\n\nTo use, simply run with the class name you want to decompile (either as a path to a class file, or as a fully qualified classname on your classpath), and optionally the method name. (`--help` to list arguments). Alternately, to decompile an entire jar, simply provide the jar path, and if you want to emit files (which you probably do!) add `--outputdir /tmp/putithere`.\n\nSee project page or [FAQ](http://www.benf.org/other/cfr/faq.html) for more details.", "updated": "2024-03-05T18:03:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/cfr/0.152", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/cfr/0.152", "licenseUrl": "http://www.benf.org/other/cfr/license.html", "packageName": "cfr", "displayName": "CFR", "summary": "CFR is a command-line Java decompiler.", "version": "0.152", "icon": "", "author": "Lee Benfield", "downloadCount": 6353, "tags": ["cfr", "java", "decompiler"]}
