It performs operations such as:\n* [page splitting](https://github.com/scantailor/scantailor/wiki/Split-Pages),\n* [deskewing](https://github.com/scantailor/scantailor/wiki/Deskew),\n* [adding/removing borders](https://github.com/scantailor/scantailor/wiki/Page-Layout),\n* [selecting content](https://github.com/scantailor/scantailor/wiki/Select-Content)\n* ... and others.\n\nYou give it raw scans, and you get pages ready to be printed or assembled into a PDF or [DjVu](http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/djvu.html) file. Scanning, optical character recognition, and assembling multi-page documents are out of scope of this project.\n\nFor more information about ScanTailor Advanced see [the official README.me](https://github.com/4lex4/scantailor-advanced/blob/master/README.md).\n\n## Parameters\n* `/InstallationPath:` - where to install the binaries\n    - Default value: `\"$env:ProgramFiles\\ScanTailor Advanced\"`\n\n### Examples\n* Install into `D:\\scantailor-advanced` directory\n    ```\n    choco install scantailor-advanced --params \"/InstallationPath:D:\\scantailor-advanced\"\n    ```", "updated": "2024-03-15T10:33:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/scantailor-advanced/2019.8.16", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/scantailor-advanced/2019.8.16", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/4lex4/scantailor-advanced/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "scantailor-advanced", "displayName": "ScanTailor Advanced", "summary": "ScanTailor Advanced is the ScanTailor fork that merges the features of the ScanTailor Featured and ScanTailor Enhanced versions, brings new ones and fixes.", "version": "2019.8.16", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jakublevy/chocopkgs/icons/scantailor.png", "author": "4lex4", "downloadCount": 440, "tags": ["scantailor", "scan", "book", "book-scanner", "image-processing", "post-processing", "digitalization", "binarization", "page", "deskew", "dewarp", "tiff", "pdf", "djvu", "qt"]}
