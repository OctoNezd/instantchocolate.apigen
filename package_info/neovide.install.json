{"description": "This is a simple graphical user interface for [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (an aggressively refactored and updated\nVim editor). Where possible there are some graphical improvements, but functionally it should act like the terminal UI.\n\n![Basic Screen Cap](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/neovide/neovide/e2088c5/assets/BasicScreenCap.png)\n\n## Features\n\nShould be a standard fully featured Neovim GUI. Beyond that there are some visual niceties:\n\n### Ligatures\n\nSupports ligatures and font shaping.\n\n![Ligatures](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/neovide/neovide/e2088c5/assets/Ligatures.png)\n\n### Animated Cursor\n\nCursor animates into position with a smear effect to improve tracking of cursor position.\n\n![Animated Cursor](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/neovide/neovide/e2088c5/assets/AnimatedCursor.gif)\n\n### Smooth Scrolling\n\nScroll operations on buffers in neovim will be animated smoothly pixel wise rather than line by line at a time. Note, multigrid must be\nenabled for this to work.\nhttps://github.com/neovide/neovide/wiki/Configuration#multigrid\n\n![Smooth Scrolling](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/neovide/neovide/e2088c5/assets/SmoothScrolling.gif)\n\n### Animated Windows\n\nWindows animate into position when they are moved making it easier to see how layout changes happen. Note, multigrid must be enabled for\nthis to work.\nhttps://github.com/neovide/neovide/wiki/Configuration#multigrid\n\n![Animated Windows](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/neovide/neovide/e2088c5/assets/AnimatedWindows.gif)\n\n### Blurred Floating Windows\n\nThe backgrounds of floating windows are blurred improving the visual separation between foreground and background from\nbuilt in window transparency. Note, multigrid must be enabled for this to work.\nhttps://github.com/neovide/neovide/wiki/Configuration#multigrid\n\n![Blurred Floating Windows](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/neovide/neovide/e2088c5/assets/BlurredFloatingWindows.png)\n\n### Emoji Support\n\nFont fallback supports rendering of emoji not contained in the configured font.\n\n![Emoji](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/neovide/neovide/e2088c5/assets/Emoji.png)\n\n### WSL Support\n\nNeovide supports displaying a full gui window from inside wsl via the `--wsl` command argument. Communication is passed via standard io into the wsl copy of neovim providing identical experience similar to visual studio code's remote editing https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview.\n\n### Remote TCP Support\n\nNeovide supports connecting to a remote instance of Neovim over a TCP socket via the `--remote-tcp` command argument. This would allow you to run Neovim on a remote machine and use the GUI on your local machine, connecting over the network.\n\nLaunch Neovim as a TCP server (on port 6666) by running:\n\n```sh\nnvim --headless --listen localhost:6666\n```\n\nAnd then connect to it using:\n\n```sh\n/path/to/neovide --remote-tcp=localhost:6666\n```\n\nBy specifying to listen on localhost, you only allow connections from your local computer. If you are actually doing this over a network you will want to use SSH port forwarding for security, and then connect as before.\n\n```sh\nssh -L 6666:localhost:6666 ip.of.other.machine nvim --headless --listen localhost:6666\n```\n\nFinally, if you would like to leave the neovim server running, close the neovide application window instead of issuing a `:q` command.\n\n### Some Nonsense ;)\n\n```vim\nlet g:neovide_cursor_vfx_mode = \"railgun\"\n```\n\n![Railgun](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/neovide/neovide/e2088c5/assets/Railgun.gif)\n\n### More to Come\n\nWe've got more ideas for simple unobtrusive improvements. More to come.\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfiguration is done almost completely via global neovide variables in your vim config and can be manipulated live at runtime.
