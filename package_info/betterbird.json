{"description": "Betterbird is a fine-tuned version of Mozilla Thunderbird, Thunderbird on steroids, if you will.\n\nBetterbird is better than Thunderbird in three ways: It contains new features exclusive to Betterbird, it contains bug fixes exclusive to Betterbird and it contains fixes that Thunderbird may ship at a later stage.\n\n## Package Parameters\n\n- `/l:LOCALE` - Install given Betterbird locale. See the [official page](https://www.betterbird.eu/downloads/) for a complete list of available locales.\n- `/UseMozillaFallback` Makes a request to mozilla.org and reads the supported Language Culture code from the website.\n\n### Examples\n\n`choco install betterbird --params \"/l=de\"`\n\n## Notes\n\n- If locale package parameter is not present, this package installs Betterbird in the first language which matches this list:\n  1. If Betterbird is already installed: the same language as the already installed Betterbird.\n  1. The Windows system language where the Betterbird package gets installed.\n  1. Language Culture code specified on Mozilla website (only when `/UseMozillaFallback` is specified).\n  1.
