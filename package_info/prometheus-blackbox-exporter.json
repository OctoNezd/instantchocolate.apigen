{"description": "The blackbox exporter allows blackbox probing of network endpoints over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP and ICMP. Additional modules can be defined to suit other needs.\n\nQuerying of endpoints happens via HTTP GET queries, by specifying the target name and what kind of probing to execute. Results from the probe are returned as a set of Prometheus metrics.", "updated": "2024-03-19T02:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/prometheus-blackbox-exporter/0.12.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/prometheus-blackbox-exporter/0.12.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "prometheus-blackbox-exporter", "displayName": "Blackbox prober for Prometheus", "summary": "From metrics to insight", "version": "0.12.0", "icon": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/588945677599780865/mrhc1gSh.png", "author": "Prometheus", "downloadCount": 4805, "tags": ["data", "prometheus", "metric", "monitoring", "admin"]}
