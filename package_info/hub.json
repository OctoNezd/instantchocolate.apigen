{"description": "hub is a command line tool that wraps git in order to extend it with extra features and commands that make working with GitHub easier.\n\n``` bash\n$ hub clone rtomayko/tilt\n\n# expands to:\n$ git clone git://github.com/rtomayko/tilt.git\n```\n\nhub is best aliased as `git`, so you can type `$ git <command>` in the shell and get all the usual `hub` features.\n\n**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package.
