{"description": "PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness. It runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, SGI IRIX, Mac OS X, Solaris, Tru64), and Windows. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages). \n    It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for C/C++, Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and exceptional documentation.\n\nThis package creates a Windows user with username postgres and password Ur@n!um824. This is the same as the postgres admin user it creates.\n\nPlease do not try and use the -x86 flag to install the 32-bit version on a 64-bit system. This will cause problems with this package.", "updated": "2024-03-22T06:18:42Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/postgresql-9.3/9.3.5.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/postgresql-9.3/9.3.5.3", "licenseUrl": "http://www.postgresql.org/about/licence", "packageName": "postgresql-9.3", "displayName": "PostgreSQL 9.3.x", "summary": "PostgreSQL - The world's most advanced open source database.", "version": "9.3.5.3", "icon": "http://www.postgresql.org/media/img/about/press/elephant64.png", "author": "EnterpriseDB", "downloadCount": 4611, "tags": ["postgresql", "database", "sql", "chocolatey", "admin"]}
