{"description": "RoboMirror is a GUI front-end for the quite popular Robocopy.exe command-line utility for Windows.\n\nRobocopy is shipped with Windows since Vista and available as free SDK tool for previous Windows versions (RoboMirror already includes it).\nIt allows to robustly synchronize two directory trees, both locally and across the network. It is therefore often used for mirroring purposes, e.g., as a powerful yet free backup utility.\n\n![alt text](http://robomirror.sourceforge.net/MainForm.png)\n\nRoboMirror's aim is to make Robocopy more accessible by providing a very simple and user-centered GUI, because most users simply don't want to work directly with the console or are overwhelmed by Robocopy's flexibility.\n\nAdditionally, RoboMirror supports volume shadow copies. This allows to copy files locked by running processes (Outlook, SQL Server...).\n\n####Requirements:\n\n* Windows XP/Server 2003 or newer\n* .NET Framework 4.0", "updated": "2024-03-22T15:03:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/robomirror/2.0.20161009", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/robomirror/2.0.20161009", "licenseUrl": "https://sourceforge.net/directory/os:windows/license:gpl/", "packageName": "robomirror", "displayName": "RoboMirror (Install)", "summary": "RoboMirror is a GUI front-end for the quite popular Robocopy.exe command-line utility for Windows.", "version": "2.0.20161009", "icon": "http://img.informer.com/icons/png/48/5505/5505163.png", "author": "Martin Kinkelin", "downloadCount": 3870, "tags": ["robomirror", "robocopy", "sync", "synchronize", "backup", "admin"]}
