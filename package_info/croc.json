AFAIK, _croc_ is the only CLI file-transfer tool that does **all** of the following:\n\n- allows **any two computers** to transfer data (using a relay)\n- provides **end-to-end encryption** (using PAKE)\n- enables easy **cross-platform** transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)\n- allows **multiple file** transfers\n- allows **resuming transfers** that are interrupted\n- local server or port-forwarding **not needed**\n- **ipv6-first** with ipv4 fallback\n- can **use proxy**, like tor\n\n## Usage\n\nTo send a file, simply do:\n\n```\n$ croc send [file(s)-or-folder]\nSending 'file-or-folder' (X MB)\nCode is: code-phrase\n```\n\nThen to receive the file (or folder) on another computer, you can just do\n\n```\ncroc code-phrase\n```\n\nThe code phrase is used to establish password-authenticated key agreement ([PAKE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement)) which generates a secret key for the sender and recipient to use for end-to-end encryption.\n\nThere are a number of configurable options (see `--help`). A set of options (like custom relay, ports, and code phrase) can be set using `--remember`.\n\n### Custom code phrase\n\nYou can send with your own code phrase (must be more than 6 characters).\n\n```\ncroc send --code [code-phrase] [file(s)-or-folder]\n```\n\n### Allow overwriting without prompt\n\nBy default, croc will prompt whether to overwrite a file. You can automatically overwrite files by using the `--overwrite` flag (recipient only). For example, receive a file to automatically overwrite:\n\n```\ncroc --yes --overwrite <code>\n```\n\n### Send text\n\nSometimes you want to send URLs or short text. In addition to piping, you can easily send text with `croc`:\n\n```\ncroc send --text \"hello world\"\n```\n\nThis will automatically tell the receiver to use `stdout` when they receive the text so it will be displayed.\n\nCheck out the [official repository](https://github.com/schollz/croc) for more information.", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:33:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/croc/9.6.14", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/croc/9.6.14", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/schollz/croc/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "croc", "displayName": "croc", "summary": "Easily and securely send things from one computer to another \ud83d\udc0a \ud83d\udce6", "version": "9.6.14", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/kamack38/packages/e955e4a1bd6e62aa2aa4a4d6b28c693509ac3fb7/assets/croc.png", "author": "schollz,  contributors", "downloadCount": 28174, "tags": ["croc", "file", "transfer", "send", "encryption"]}
