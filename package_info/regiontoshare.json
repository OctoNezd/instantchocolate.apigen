{"description": "A Windows helper app to share only a part of a screen via video conference apps that only support either full screen or single window like e.g. Teams, WebEx, etc.\n\n## How it works\n\nThis tool simply mirrors the content of a screen region into a hidden window. In your meeting app you then can just share the content of this hidden window.\n\n**Region to Share is not aware of your meeting app nor what the meeting app is doing with the content of the window.**\nIt's up to your meeting app whether it properly shares this hidden windows content or not - if it's not working as expected, there is nothing Region to Share can do about this.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Windows 10 or 11\n- DotNet 4.6.2 or newer\n\n## Installation\n\n- Download and install this app from the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N4066W2R5Q4)\n  or pick the latest binariers from the [release page](https://github.com/tom-englert/RegionToShare/releases)\n\n## Usage\n\n- Start the \"RegionToShare\" app.\n- Move the window to the region you want to share.\n- In your meeting app start sharing the window \"Region to Share\".\n\n![StartSharing](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tom-englert/RegionToShare@main/src/Assets/StartSharing.gif)\n\n- Now click the \"Region to Share\" window to start sharing the selected region.\n  The window will change to the region selection frame, and others are seeing what's inside this frame.\n- Close the region frame to stop showing the region without stopping to share.\n\n![ShowRegion](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tom-englert/RegionToShare@main/src/Assets/ShowRegion.gif)", "updated": "2024-03-23T13:33:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/regiontoshare/1.10.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/regiontoshare/1.10.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/tom-englert/RegionToShare/blob/main/LICENSE", "packageName": "regiontoshare", "displayName": "Region to Share", "summary": "A Windows helper app to share only a part of a screen via video conference apps that only support either full screen or single window like e.g. Teams, WebEx, etc.", "version": "1.10.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tom-englert/RegionToShare@main/src/Assets/128.png", "author": "Tom Englert", "downloadCount": 252, "tags": ["regiontoshare", "video", "conference", "screen", "share"]}
