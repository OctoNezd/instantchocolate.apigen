{"description": "Scanner for Simple Indicators of Compromise\n\nDetection is based on four detection methods:\n\n    1. File Name IOC\n       Regex match on full file path/name\n\n    2. Yara Rule Check\n       Yara signature match on file data and process memory\n\n    3. Hash Check\n       Compares known malicious hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) with scanned files\n       \n    4. C2 Back Connect Check\n       Compares process connection endpoints with C2 IOCs (new since version v.10)\n       \nAdditional Checks:\n\n    1. Regin filesystem check (via --reginfs)\n    2. Process anomaly check (based on [Sysforensics](http://goo.gl/P99QZQ)\n    3. SWF decompressed scan (new since version v0.8)\n    4. SAM dump check\n\nThe Windows binary is compiled with PyInstaller and should run as x86 application on both x86 and x64 based systems.\n\n## Note on VirusTotal detections\n\nThis software is packaged using [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/),\na tool for bundling Python applications into a single executable. Apps packaged\nin this manner are often incorrectly flagged as malware.
