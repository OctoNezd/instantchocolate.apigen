It is written using Open Watcom C++ 2.0 beta, with plain C language using DOS tiny memory model in order to keep it compact.\n\nEven if FAT32 partitions are not explicitilly supported, its 64 bit arithmetic should make it support volumes of up to 256 GB in size, depending if DOS is able to properly inform about it on service 36h. If not, it will only be able to fill reported size at most.", "updated": "2024-03-13T23:48:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/zerofill/1.08", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/zerofill/1.08", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html", "packageName": "zerofill", "displayName": "ZEROFILL", "summary": "ZEROFILL writes zeros on the empty disk space for the selected drive.
