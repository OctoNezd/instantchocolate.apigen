{"description": "SQLite has few functions compared to other database management systems. SQLite\nauthors see this as a feature rather than a problem, because SQLite has an\nextension mechanism in place.\n\nThere are a lot of SQLite extensions out there, but they are incomplete,\ninconsistent and scattered across the internet. sqlean brings them together,\nneatly packaged into domain modules, documented and tested.\n\nSQLean provides a well-thought set of domain modules with a convenient API - a\nkind of standard library for SQLite.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@5c00af62769ca23287f09747288b62b554e35d06/automatic/sqlean/screenshot.png)\n\n## Package Parameters\n\n* `/InstallDir=[directory]` - set the installation directory to `[directory]`  \n  e.g. `choco install -y sqlean --package-parameters=\"/InstallDir=C:\\Tools\\sqlean\"`\n\n## Notes\n\n* Extensions distributed with sqlean are compiled in 64-bit and require a\n  64-bit SQLite version.\n* A 64-bit SQLite shell is currently not available from source but there is one\n  availabe pre-bundled with the sqlean extensions in the [sqlean-shell](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sqlean-shell)\n  package.\n* A stand-alone 64-bit SQLite shell binary is available in the [sqlite-shell-x64](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sqlite-shell-x64)\n  package.\n* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).\n  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact\n  the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating\n  correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-23T01:03:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sqlean/0.22.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/sqlean/0.22.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/blob/main/LICENSE", "packageName": "sqlean", "displayName": "sqlean - all the missing sqlite functions", "summary": "The ultimate set of SQLite extensions", "version": "0.22.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@5c00af62769ca23287f09747288b62b554e35d06/icons/sqlean.png", "author": "Anton Zhiyanov", "downloadCount": 74, "tags": ["sqlite", "sqlean", "sql", "db", "database", "embedded"]}
