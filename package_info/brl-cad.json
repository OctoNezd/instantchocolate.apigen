{"description": "BRL-CAD is a powerful cross-platform open source combinatorial solid modeling system that includes an interactive 3D solid geometry editor, a network-distributed symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) high-performance ray-tracer with support for rendering and geometric analysis, image and signal-processing tools, a system performance analysis benchmark suite, a flexible geometry scripting interface, and a high-performance geometric representation and analysis library.\n\n![Example](https://brlcad.org/gallery/_data/i/galleries/screenshots/t62_mged-me.jpg)\n\nFor more than 20 years, BRL-CAD has been the primary tri-service solid modeling CAD system used by the U.S. military to model weapons systems for vulnerability and lethality analyses.  The solid modeling system is frequently used in a wide range of military, academic, and industrial applications including in the design and analysis of vehicles, mechanical parts, and architecture.  The package has also been used in radiation dose planning, medical visualization, computer graphics education, CSG concepts and modeling education, and system performance benchmark testing among other purposes.\n\nBRL-CAD supports a great variety of geometric representations including an extensive set of traditional CSG primitive implicit solids such as boxes, ellipsoids, cones, and tori, as well as explicit solids made from closed collections of Uniform B-Spline Surfaces, Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces, n-Manifold Geometry (NMG), and purely faceted mesh geometry.  All geometric objects may be combined using boolean set-theoretic CSG operations such as union, intersection, and difference.\n\nActively developed since 1979, BRL-CAD is a collection of more than 400 tools, utilities, and applications comprising more than a million lines of source code.  It's actively developed for many operating systems including BSD, IRIX, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, Windows, and more.", "updated": "2024-03-22T14:33:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/brl-cad/7.38.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/brl-cad/7.38.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/blob/main/COPYING", "packageName": "brl-cad", "displayName": "BRL-CAD", "summary": "BRL-CAD is a powerful cross-platform open source solid modeling system.", "version": "7.38.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages@6055c7648c9ab5939718e84f6610d8b60bb3a1c6/Icons/brl-cad_icon.png", "author": "Army Research Laboratory", "downloadCount": 394, "tags": ["brl-cad", "cad", "solid", "modeling", "raytrace", "dwg", "dwf", "FOSS", "embedded"]}
