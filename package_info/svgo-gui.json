{"description": "The svgo-gui app is using the node-webkit app runtime to call the SVGO Nodejs tool in a minimalist and highly intuitive GUI. Working with the svgo-gui app is extremely streamlined: drag and drop the files you want to process on top of the app\u2019s main window, and the utility takes care of the rest.\n\n            Within the svgo-gui main window you will see a list with all the processed SVG files, their initial size, the output size, and the how much space has been saved expressed in percents. All the optimization is performed automatically, without requiring any user interaction.\n\n            **Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-20T12:33:40Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/svgo-gui/0.0.9", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/svgo-gui/0.0.9", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svg/svgo-gui/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "svgo-gui", "displayName": "SVGO GUI", "summary": "Node-WebKit based GUI for SVGO.", "version": "0.0.9", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/criography/chocolatey-packages/v1.9/automatic/svgo-gui/icon.svg", "author": "Kir Belevich", "downloadCount": 998, "tags": ["optimize", "SVG-clean", "SVG", "SVG-cleaner", "SVG-optimiser", "image-optimiser"]}
