This also read by this extension if configured.\n\nTo determine what config to use, the extention will look for a config file in the following places:\n\n1. a `.cz-config.js` in the root directory\n2. in `package.json` to determine the path to the config file:\n   ```json\n   \"config\": {\n     \"cz-customizable\": {\n       \"config\": \"test.js\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n3. use the default config", "updated": "2024-03-12T09:03:20Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vscode-commitizen/1.1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vscode-commitizen/1.1.0", "licenseUrl": "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/KnisterPeter.vscode-commitizen/license", "packageName": "vscode-commitizen", "displayName": "Visual Studio Code Commitizen Support", "summary": "Adds support for commitizen to vscode", "version": "1.1.0", "icon": "", "author": "Markus Wolf", "downloadCount": 1610, "tags": ["vscode-commitizen", "extension", "vscode", "git", "commit", "commitizen"]}
