{"description": "Studio is a desktop application that allows users to build LEGO models using virtual parts. Users will have the freedom to build whatever they want with any part they want. By being integrated with the BrickLink catalog, Studio can do things like showing you what part colors are unavailable and letting you keep track of part costs. Studio also makes it easy to turn a finished creation into a wanted list that you can use to order through BrickLink.\n\n![Batmobile](https://static.bricklink.com/renovate/img/studio-landing/1989-batmobile.gif)\n\n* **Intuitive and easy building** -- Watch as your bricks clutch, hinge, and clip to each other through our snap-to functionality.
