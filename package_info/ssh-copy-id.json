{"description": "## Synopsis\n    `ssh-copy-id [user@]machine [-i [identity_file]]`\n\n    ## Description\n    `ssh-copy-id` is a script that uses ssh to log into a remote machine (presumably using a login password, so password authentication should be enabled, unless you've done some clever use of multiple identities) It also changes the permissions of the remote user's home, `~/.ssh`, and `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` to remove group writability (which would otherwise prevent you from logging in, if the remote sshd has StrictModes set in its configuration). If the -i option is given then the identity file (defaults to `%userprofile%\\.ssh\\id_rsa.pub`) is used, regardless of whether there are any keys in your ssh-agent. If the -i option is used, or the ssh-add produced no output, then it uses the contents of the identity file. Once it has one or more fingerprints (by whatever means) it uses ssh to append them to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote machine (creating the file, and directory, if necessary)", "updated": "2024-03-23T17:48:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ssh-copy-id/0.1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ssh-copy-id/0.1.0", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "ssh-copy-id", "displayName": "ssh-copy-id (Install)", "summary": "ssh-copy-id - install your public key in a remote machine's authorized_keys", "version": "0.1.0", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/img/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Gnome-fs-ssh.png", "author": "n3rd4i", "downloadCount": 5439, "tags": ["ssh-copy-id", "ssh"]}
