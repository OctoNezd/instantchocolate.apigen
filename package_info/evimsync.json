{"description": "EvImSync is a small tool to synchronize Evernote notebooks with a Gmail account. Notes in Evernote are uploaded to your Gmail account as emails, and emails in Gmail are imported to Evernote notebooks as notes.\n\nEvImSync uses the Evernote script engine ENScript.exe to import and export notes. These notes are parsed and then compared to emails in your Gmail account using the IMAP protocol. This requires that you have enabled IMAP in your Gmail settings.\n\n[Source code](https://sourceforge.net/p/evimsync/code/HEAD/tree/)", "updated": "2024-03-14T14:33:34Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/evimsync/1.0.0.118", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/evimsync/1.0.0.118", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html", "packageName": "evimsync", "displayName": "EvImSync", "summary": "Sync Evernote notes with IMAP, Import Evernote to Onenote", "version": "1.0.0.118", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/e3ea80de5618050c03844acca92f612fb1243723/icons/evimsync.ico", "author": "Stefan Kueng", "downloadCount": 978, "tags": ["sync", "imap", "evernote", "onenote"]}
