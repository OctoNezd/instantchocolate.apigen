A single instance of Privaxy on a small virtual machine, server or even, on the same computer as the traffic is originating from, can filter thousands of requests per second while requiring a very small amount of memory.\n\nPrivaxy is not limited by the browser\u2019s APIs and can operate with any HTTP traffic, not only the traffic flowing from web browsers.\n\nPrivaxy is also way more capable than DNS-based blockers as it is able to operate directly on URLs and to inject resources into web pages.\n\n# Features\n- Suppport for [Adblock Plus filters](https://adblockplus.org/filter-cheatsheet), such as [easylist](https://easylist.to/).\n- Web graphical user interface with a statistics display as well as a live request explorer.\n- Support for uBlock origin's js syntax.\n- Support for uBlock origin's redirect syntax.\n- Support for uBlock origin's scriptlets.\n- Browser and HTTP client agnostic.\n- Support for custom filters.\n- Support for excluding hosts from the MITM pipeline.\n- Support for protocol upgrades, such as with websockets.\n- Automatic filter lists updates.\n- Very low resource usage.\n    - Around 50MB of memory with approximately 320 000 filters enabled.\n    - Able to filter thousands of requests per second on a small machine.\n\n*Please Note:* This is an automatically updated package.
