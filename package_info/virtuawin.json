{"description": "VirtuaWin is a virtual desktop manager for the Windows operating system (Win9x/ME/NT/Win2K/XP/Win2003/Vista/Win7). A virtual desktop manager lets you organize applications over several virtual desktops (also called 'workspaces'). Virtual desktops are very common in Unix/Linux, and once you get accustomed to using them, they become an essential part of a productive workflow.\n\tVirtuaWin is designed to be simple and elegant to use yet still be highly configurable and extensible.", "updated": "2024-03-22T07:33:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/virtuawin/4.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/virtuawin/4.4", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html", "packageName": "virtuawin", "displayName": "VirtuaWin", "summary": "VirtuaWin is a virtual desktop manager for Windows.", "version": "4.4", "icon": "http://virtuawin.sourceforge.net/img/misc/vw_icon34x34.png", "author": "VirtuaWin", "downloadCount": 4114, "tags": ["virtual", "desktop", "workspaces"]}
