{"description": "I've created a little command line tool which captures a screenshot every once in a while (you can set the interval in minutes) and saves it to a specific location on your PC. I save them to my Dropbox. I also copied a link to the tool in my startup folder, so everytime my work laptop starts, the program opens. Now, when I need to go back in time; no problem! I've got a folder filled with screenshots.", "updated": "2024-03-12T08:03:18Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/iforgot/0.2.44", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/iforgot/0.2.44", "licenseUrl": "https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT", "packageName": "iforgot", "displayName": "IForgot", "summary": "Lightweight daily screen capture tool", "version": "0.2.44", "icon": "", "author": "Duco Winterwerp", "downloadCount": 1332, "tags": ["iforgot", "screenshot"]}
