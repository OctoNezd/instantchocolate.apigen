{"description": "## PSLab Desktop\n It is using ElectronJS running React on top as UI renderer and uses Python scripts under the hood\n for device communication. The goal of PSLab is to create an Open Source hardware device (open on\n all layers) and software applications that can be used for experiments by teachers, students and\n scientists. Our tiny pocket lab provides an array of instruments for doing science and engineering\n experiments. It provides functions of numerous measurement tools including an oscilloscope, a\n waveform generator, a frequency counter, a programmable voltage, current source and even a component\n to control robots with up to four servos. Our website is at [PSLab.io](https://pslab.io/).
