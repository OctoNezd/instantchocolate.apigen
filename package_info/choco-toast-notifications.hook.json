This hook supersedes, replaces, and expands upon my [Chocolatey Toast Notifications Extension](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey-toast-notifications.extension). **Chocolatey Toast Notifications Hook** is even better than the extension as it works with ALL packages no matter if they have a program installer or not. **Chocolatey Toast Notifications Hook** also determines the difference between installs and upgrades and reports such. It's pretty and Chocotastic!\n\n### PURPOSE:\n\n* Chocogeeky fun!\n\n### FEATURES: \n* **Choco Toast Notifications Hook** will display a toast notification with the package name, program name, version, status message (installed, uninstalled, or upgraded), and a link to the package page on the chocolatey.org website after a package is installed, uninstalled, or upgraded.\n\n### WHAT IT WON'T DO:\n* **Choco Toast Notifications Hook** will NOT work on anything other than Windows 10 and 11, this is a limitation of the [BurntToast](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast) PowerShell module and its use of the [UWP Community Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsCommunityToolkit).\n\n**If you like this little hook, please consider donating: https://www.paypal.me/bcurran3donations or become a patron at https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3**", "updated": "2024-03-20T03:48:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-toast-notifications.hook/1.1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/choco-toast-notifications.hook/1.1.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html", "packageName": "choco-toast-notifications.hook", "displayName": "(unofficial) Choco Toast Notifications (Hook)", "summary": "Choco Toast Notifications Hook is a Chocolatey hook that displays a toast notification after installing, uninstalling, or upgrading a package.", "version": "1.1.0", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/choco-toast-notifications.hook/choco-toast-notifications.hook_icon.png", "author": "Bill Curran", "downloadCount": 194, "tags": ["bcurran3", "unofficial", "choco", "toast", "notifications", "hook"]}
