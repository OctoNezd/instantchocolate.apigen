{"description": "FindThatFont! is a handy tool to browse fonts that are installed on your system and to classify them into over 30 different categories. By using this categorization you can find any font on your system faster than ever before.\n\nNote: Development on FindThatFont! halted. It works nicely and is stable, but (scroll down) further development is appreciated. Anyone willing to adopt the project is welcome to do so.\n\nThe project contains an example addon (located in the /PreviewBox folder) that shows a larger preview of the selected font, as a fancy bit of Lipsum, or as a character map.\n\n[Source code](https://github.com/monkeyinmysoup/FindThatFont-)", "updated": "2024-03-11T15:18:39Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/findthatfont/1.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/findthatfont/1.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/monkeyinmysoup/FindThatFont-/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "findthatfont", "displayName": "FindThatFont!", "summary": "Preview and classify installed fonts", "version": "1.0.0", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/93b58baaae2ba8e6363b016fb61e325605d2f985/icons/findthatfont.png", "author": "Mathijs Lagerberg", "downloadCount": 1040, "tags": ["font-viewer", "typeface"]}
