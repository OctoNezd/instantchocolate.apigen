{"description": "## Autoruns\nSee what programs are configured to startup automatically when your system boots and you login. \nAutoruns also shows you the full list of Registry and file locations where applications can \nconfigure auto-start settings. This utility, which has the most comprehensive knowledge of \nauto-starting locations of any startup monitor, shows you what programs are configured to run \nduring system bootup or login, and when you start various built-in Windows applications like \nInternet Explorer, Explorer and media players. These programs and drivers include ones in your \nstartup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other Registry keys. Autoruns\u00a0reports Explorer shell \nextensions, toolbars, browser helper objects, Winlogon notifications, auto-start services, and \nmuch more.\u00a0Autoruns goes way beyond other autostart utilities.\n\n### Package-specific issue\nIf this package isn't up-to-date for some days, [Create an issue](https://github.com/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages/issues/new/choose)\n\nSupport the package maintainer and [![Patreon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@d15c4e19c709e7148588d4523ffc6dd3cd3c7e5e/icons/patreon.png)](https://www.patreon.com/tunisiano)", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/AutoRuns/14.11.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/AutoRuns/14.11.0", "licenseUrl": "https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb469936", "packageName": "AutoRuns", "displayName": "Autoruns", "summary": "What programs are configured to startup automatically", "version": "14.11.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@90497a9b07e46fd5816b6f9b5ac307a7a625b19a/icons/autoruns.jpg", "author": "Mark Russinovich, Bryce Cogswell", "downloadCount": 2814249, "tags": ["startup", "sysinternals"]}
