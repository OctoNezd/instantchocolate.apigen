{"description": "## What is this?\n**win-vind** provides a lightweight hybrid UI system of CUI and GUI for Windows.  \nBy installing this tool, you will be able to control the Windows GUI in the same way as Vim.\n\n### 1. Vim-user friendly.\nAll configuration methods and mode concepts are derived from Vim, allowing for Vim-like UI operation.  \nVim users only need to understand win-vind's macro features and additional mode concepts with little learning cost.  \n\n### 2. There are many useful built-in commands.\nYou don't have to worry about complicated scripts and dependencies like with traditional key binding tools.  \nYou can freely create user-defined commands by combining low-level optimized built-in commands.\n\n### 3. Very portable and fully open source.\nwin-vind is a small single binary with no dependencies that runs with user permissions.   \nIt is also available from the command line as a command for UI operations like `$ win-vind -c \"ggyyGp\"`.", "updated": "2024-03-23T14:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/win-vind/5.11.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/win-vind/5.11.3", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/pit-ray/win-vind/blob/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "win-vind", "displayName": "win-vind (Install)", "summary": "You can operate Windows with key bindings like Vim.", "version": "5.11.3", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/pit-ray/win-vind/master/res/icon.png", "author": "pit-ray", "downloadCount": 2131, "tags": ["win-vind", "vim", "windows", "hotkeys", "mouse", "window-manager", "keybindings", "vim-emulation", "vim-key-binder", "gui-operation"]}
