{"description": "CountryTraceRoute is a Traceroute utility, similar to the tracert tool of Windows, but with a graphical user interface, and it's also much faster than tracert of Windows.\n\nCountryTraceRoute also displays the country of the owner of every IP address found in the Traceroute.\n\nAfter the Traceroute is completed, you can select all items (Ctrl+A) and then save them into csv/tab-delimited/html/xml file with 'Save Selected Items' option (Ctrl+S) or copy them to the clipboard (Ctrl+C) and then paste the result into Excel or another spreadsheet application.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@48b2855247b0e422e994f50e85b9bf8c8ca98c79/automatic/countrytraceroute/screenshot.png)\n\n## Notes\n\n* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).\n  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-19T07:48:34Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/countrytraceroute/1.40", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/countrytraceroute/1.40", "licenseUrl": "http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/country_traceroute.html", "packageName": "countrytraceroute", "displayName": "CountryTraceRoute - Traceroute with IP Country Information", "summary": "Fast GUI Traceroute with IP country information", "version": "1.40", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@ec1652f85e86682fba61efdbeb5a556dd6ad0284/icons/countrytraceroute.png", "author": "Nir Sofer", "downloadCount": 3043, "tags": ["traceroute", "ip", "geolocation", "gui", "nirsoft"]}
