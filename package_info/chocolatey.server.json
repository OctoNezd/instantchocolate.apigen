{"description": "Chocolatey Server is a simple OData feed built on top of NuGet.Server.\n\nChocolatey Server builds on NuGet.Server with a few minor adjustments:\n\n * This is a packaged site, ready to deploy.\n * The apikey is already set.\n * There is more helpful information on the site when accessing locally:\n   * There is a link to the Elmah logs\n   * The api key is given on the page.\n * The location of packages defaults to a more secure location.\n\n### Links\n\n* Setup - https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/guides/organizations/set-up-chocolatey-server\n* Source Code - https://github.com/chocolatey-community/simple-server/\n* Issues/Requests - https://github.com/chocolatey-community/simple-server/issues\n\n### Notes\n\nThis package will NOT give you a local copy of what is available on https://community.chocolatey.org.\n\nChocolatey.Server is not recommended for most organizational use cases. There are more robust options out there. However\nif you have a very simple use case or are conducting a POC, Chocolatey.Server may be good enough for your needs. If you\ndon't find it robust enough, our recommendation is to look to something more robust like Artifactory, Nexus, or ProGet\n(two of which are also free to use).", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey.server/0.3.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/chocolatey.server/0.3.0", "licenseUrl": "http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0", "packageName": "chocolatey.server", "displayName": "Chocolatey Server (Simple)", "summary": "Chocolatey Server is a simple OData feed built on top of NuGet.Server.", "version": "0.3.0", "icon": "https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/raw/master/docs/logo/chocolateyicon.gif", "author": "Rob Reynolds", "downloadCount": 57803, "tags": ["nuget", "odata", "iis", "repository", "chocolatey", "simple-server", "simple.server"]}
