{"description": "This agent is based on a fork of [FusionInventory agent](https://github.com/fusioninventory/fusioninventory-agent) and so works mainly like FusionInventory agent. It introduces new features and a new protocol to communicate directly with a GLPI server and its native inventory feature. Anyway it also keeps the compatibility with [FusionInventory for GLPI plugin](https://github.com/fusioninventory/fusioninventory-for-glpi).\n\n\n**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated [Chocolatey package](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages). If you find it is\nout of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and\nlet them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-21T09:03:50Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/glpi-agent-nightly/1.7.20231118", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/glpi-agent-nightly/1.7.20231118", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi-agent/blob/3c563ae1/LICENSE", "packageName": "glpi-agent-nightly", "displayName": "GLPI Agent Nightly v1.7-git3c563ae1", "summary": "The GLPI Agent is a generic management agent.
