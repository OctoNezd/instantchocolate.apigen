{"description": "An implementation of the traditional UNIX macro processor in that it copies its input to the output, expanding macros as it goes. Macros are either built-in or user-defined and can take any number of arguments. M4 also has built-in functions for including named files, running UNIX commands, doing integer arithmetic, manipulating text in various ways, and recursions. It can also be used as either a front-end to a compiler or as a macro processor in its own right. It is often used to generate HTML as it can give a consistent look to pages. If GNU m4 is meant to serve GNU autoconf, beware that m4 should be fully installed prior to configuring autoconf itself.", "updated": "2024-03-23T04:48:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gnuwin32-m4/1.4.14", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/gnuwin32-m4/1.4.14", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html", "packageName": "gnuwin32-m4", "displayName": "GnuWin32 m4 (Portable)", "summary": "GnuWin32 m4 is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro processor.", "version": "1.4.14", "icon": "https://community.chocolatey.org/content/packageimages/gnuwin32-coreutils.install.5.3.0.png", "author": "GnuWin32", "downloadCount": 591, "tags": ["gnuwin32", "m4"]}
