{"description": "[Milton](https://github.com/serge-rgb/milton) is an open source application that lets you Just Paint.\n\nThere are no pixels, you can paint with (almost) infinite detail. It feels raster-based but it works with vectors. It is not an image editor. It is not a vector graphics editor. It is a program that lets you draw, sketch and paint. There is no save button, your work is persistent with unlimited undo.\n\n## What Milton is not\n\nMilton is not an image editor or a vector graphics editor. It's a program that lets you draw, sketch and paint.\n\n## User Manual\n\nIf the GUI makes something not-obvious, please create a [github issue](https://github.com/serge-rgb/milton/issues)!\n\nIt's very helpful to drag the mouse (or pen) while pressing `space` to pan the canvas.  Also, switching between the brush and the eraser with `b` and `e`.\nYou can change the brush size with `[` and `]` and control the transparency with the number keys.\n\nHere is the  [latest video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g27gHio2Ohk).\n\nCheck out the [patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/serge_rgb?ty=h) if you would like to help out. :)\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/milton.install/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-22T09:33:53Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/milton.install/1.9.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/milton.install/1.9.1", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serge-rgb/milton/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "milton.install", "displayName": "Milton (Install)", "summary": "Milton is a program that lets you draw, sketch and paint.", "version": "1.9.1", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/milton.install/milton.install.png", "author": "Sergio Gonzalez", "downloadCount": 1628, "tags": ["milton.install", "draw", "sketch", "paint"]}
