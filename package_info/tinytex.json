{"description": "# TinyTeX\n\nTinyTeX is a custom LaTeX distribution based on TeX Live that is relatively small in size, but functions well in most cases, especially for R users. If you run into the problem of missing LaTeX packages, it should be super clear to you what you need to do (in fact, R users won\u2019t need to do anything). You only install LaTeX packages you actually need.\n\nPlease see the full documentation at https://yihui.org/tinytex/.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/tinytex/2024.3.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/tinytex/2024.3.0", "licenseUrl": "https://tug.org/texlive/LICENSE.TL", "packageName": "tinytex", "displayName": "TinyTeX", "summary": "A lightweight, cross-platform, portable, and easy-to-maintain LaTeX distribution based on TeX Live", "version": "2024.3.0", "icon": "https://yihui.org/images/logo-tinytex.png", "author": "Naveen M K,  Yihui Xie,  TeX Live Developers", "downloadCount": 29875, "tags": ["tinytex", "tex", "LaTeX", "TeXLive", "tiny"]}
