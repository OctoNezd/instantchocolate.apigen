{"description": "Rename many files, folders and subfolders in one go in a quick, safe and easy way with Rons Renamer.\n\nRenaming batches of files simultaneously allows folders to be kept clean, sorted and consistent. Ideal for keeping pictures or digital snapshots, music, movies, texts or any other type of files organized.\n\n15 simple renaming rules can be combined into rulesets, and saved, allowing flexibility and fast operation. The rules contain both basic and advanced options.\n\n* Add: Space / Text / Numbers / Date-Time / Path Name / Music Tag / Image Tag\n* Remove: Space / Text / Numbers\n* Change Case\n* Replace: Date-Time / Text / Numbers\n* Split Name\n\nEXIF and Mp3 tags can be used in the new name.\n\nRenaming could not be safer with instant visual feedback (including conflict checking) of what will be renamed and the possibility of a full rollback after the renaming has been done.\n\nMore information concerning Rons Renamer can be found on our website: https://www.ronsplace.ca/Products/RonsRenamer. The developer welcomes feedback and ideas.", "updated": "2024-03-06T02:18:34Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ronsrenamer/2023.4.4.1538", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ronsrenamer/2023.4.4.1538", "licenseUrl": "https://www.ronsplace.ca/Article/Pages/Business/user-license-agreement", "packageName": "ronsrenamer", "displayName": "Rons Renamer (Install)", "summary": "Powerful Batch File Renamer", "version": "2023.4.4.1538", "icon": "https://www.ronsplace.ca/ContentProduct/RENAM/Icon.png", "author": "Aaron Stewart,  Rons Place Software", "downloadCount": 88, "tags": ["rename", "renamer", "cli", "batch", "utility", "replacement", "regex", "batch-file-rename", "multiple", "bulk", "mass", "files", "file-name", "replace", "file", "command", "line", "naming", "folders"]}
