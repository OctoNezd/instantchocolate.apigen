{"description": "Kdenlive is an acronym for KDE Non-Linear Video Editor. It is primarily aimed at the GNU/Linux platform but also works on BSD and MacOS. It is currently being ported to Windows as a GSOC project.\n\t\nNon-linear video editing is much more powerful than beginners\u2019 (linear) editors, hence it requires a bit more organization before starting. However, it is not reserved to specialists and can be used for small personal projects.", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:48:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/kdenlive/23.8.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/kdenlive/23.8.4", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt", "packageName": "kdenlive", "displayName": "kdenlive (Install)", "summary": "A powerful non-linear video editor", "version": "23.8.4", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/nathanielwarner/kdenlive-chocolatey/icon.png", "author": "Bushuev A.,  Simon A.
