{"description": "## Why\nI'm annoyed at the lack of desktop app for voice, like hangouts had.\n\n## What does it do\nIt just lets you keep voice open without a chrome browser. It will also check the dom for notifications and display a badge in the task bar and closing the app will send it to a tray instead of closing.\n\n## Supported Operating Systems\nCurrently supports both OSX, Windows 10 and Linux.\n\nQuestions? Ideas? Join us in discord https://discord.gg/3SSS6vkKET\n\n## Customize\nYou can change settings, apply themes and other things in the customization page. Go to `Electron > Settings` on Mac in the global menu bar, or `File > Settings` on windows. If you've hidden the menu bar you can also access the settings from the system tray.\n\n**Windows Settings**\n\n![Windows Settings](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jerrod-lankford/google-voice-desktop-app@master/screenshots/windowsSettings.png)\n\n**Mac Settings**\n\n![Mac Settings](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jerrod-lankford/google-voice-desktop-app@master/screenshots/macSettings.png?raw=true)\n\n**System Tray Settings**\n\n![System Tray Settings](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jerrod-lankford/google-voice-desktop-app@master/screenshots/systemTraySettings.png?raw=true)\n\n## Themes\nThe latest version now supports custom themes, which can be set in the Settings dialog.\n\nNot only themes but also a system for themeing!
