{"description": "#### This software requires a [Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/signup/dc) in order to work.\n    \nHeroku lets you deploy, run and manage applications written in Ruby, Node.js, Java, Python, Clojure, Scala, Go and PHP.\n\nAn application is a collection of source code written in one of these languages, perhaps a framework, and some dependency description that instructs a build system as to which additional dependencies are needed in order to build and run the application.\n\nDependency mechanisms vary across languages: in Ruby you use a Gemfile, in Python a requirements.txt, in Node.js a package.json, in Java a pom.xml and so on.\n\nThe source code for your application, together with the dependency file, should provide enough information for the Heroku platform to build your application, to produce something that can be executed.\n\n## Package Notes\n\nHeroku has stopped updating the executable installer since April 2021 (see issue [here](https://github.com/heroku/cli/issues/1962)). Therefore, there will be no new releases of this package unless that changes.
