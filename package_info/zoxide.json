{"description": "> A smarter cd command for your terminal\n\n[![crates.io][crates.io-badge]][crates.io]\n\n`zoxide` is a blazing fast replacement for your `cd` command, inspired by\n[`z`][z] and [`z.lua`][z.lua]. It keeps track of the directories you use most\nfrequently, and uses a ranking algorithm to navigate to the best match.\n\n![Demo][demo.gif]\n\n## Examples\n\n```sh\nz foo        # cd into highest ranked directory matching foo\nz foo bar    # cd into highest ranked directory matching foo and bar\n\nz ~/foo      # z also works like a regular cd command\nz foo/       # cd into relative path\nz ..         # cd one level up\nz -          # cd into previous directory\n\nzi foo       # cd with interactive selection (using fzf)\n```\n\nRead more about the matching algorithm [here][algorithm-matching].\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Step 1: Install `zoxide`\n\n`zoxide` works across all major platforms. If your distribution isn't included\nin the list below, you can download the binary from the [Releases] page and\ncopy it to your `$PATH`.\n\n### Step 2: Install `fzf` (optional)\n\n[`fzf`][fzf] is a command-line fuzzy finder, used by zoxide for interactive\nselection. Installation instructions can be found [here][fzf-installation].\n\n### Step 3: Add `zoxide` to your shell\n\nSee https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide#step-3-add-zoxide-to-your-shell for available options.\n\n## Configuration\n\n### `init` flags\n\n- `--cmd`: changes the prefix of predefined aliases (`z`, `zi`).\n  - e.g. `--cmd j` would change the aliases to `j` and `ji` respectively.\n- `--hook <HOOK>`: change how often zoxide increments a directory's score:\n  - `none`: never automatically add directories to zoxide.\n  - `prompt`: add the current directory to zoxide at every shell prompt.\n  - `pwd`: whenever the user changes directories, add the new directory to\n    zoxide.\n- `--no-aliases`: don't define extra aliases (`z`, `zi`).\n  - These functions will still be available in your shell as `__zoxide_z` and\n    `__zoxide_zi`, should you choose to use them elsewhere.\n\n### Environment variables\n\nhttps://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide#environment-variables\n\n## Third-party integrations\n\n- [nnn], via [autojump plugin][nnn-autojump]\n- [xxh], via [xxh-plugin-prerun-zoxide]\n\n[algorithm-matching]: https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/wiki/Algorithm#matching\n[crates.io-badge]: https://img.shields.io/crates/v/zoxide\n[crates.io]: https://crates.io/crates/zoxide\n[demo.gif]: https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/raw/main/demo.gif\n[fzf-installation]: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation\n[fzf]: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf\n[nnn-autojump]: https://github.com/jarun/nnn/blob/master/plugins/autojump\n[nnn]: https://github.com/jarun/nnn\n[releases]: https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/releases\n[xxh-plugin-prerun-zoxide]: https://github.com/xxh/xxh-plugin-prerun-zoxide\n[xxh]: https://github.com/xxh/xxh\n[z.lua]: https://github.com/skywind3000/z.lua\n[z]: https://github.com/rupa/z", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:03:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/zoxide/0.9.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/zoxide/0.9.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/blob/main/LICENSE", "packageName": "zoxide", "displayName": "zoxide", "summary": "A smarter cd command.
