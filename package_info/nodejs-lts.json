{"description": "Node.js\u00ae is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.\n\n#### This package is the **LTS** (Long Term Support) release of Node.js. See the [LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts-schedule) for more information.\n\n#### If you want the **Current** release, install the [nodejs](https://chocolatey.org/packages/nodejs) package instead.\n\n## Maintainer's Note\n\nI produce and maintain Chocolatey packages in my spare time, for free. If you use my packages, and appreciate the time and effort I put into making and maintaining them, please consider [making a small donation](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jtcmedia).
