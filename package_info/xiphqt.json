{"description": "Xiph QuickTime Components (XiphQT) is a set of QuickTime and Macintosh OS X plug-ins. Their role is to provide support for Xiph media compression and container formats.\n\nIf you are an end user: installing XiphQT components is all you need to start using Xiph-formatted media files in a variety of applications - for example, listening to Ogg/Vorbis files in QuickTime Player or iTunes. The programming interfaces used in XiphQT allow the provided functionality to be available transparently to all media handling applications using QuickTime or OS X component mechanisms.\n\nIf you are a programmer, you have built a Macintosh Core Audio or QuickTime-based application and would like to add Xiph formats support: most of the time there is hardly anything you will need to do to add support.", "updated": "2024-03-19T18:03:45Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/xiphqt/0.1.5", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/xiphqt/0.1.5", "licenseUrl": "http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/lgpl.html#TOC1", "packageName": "xiphqt", "displayName": "Xiph QuickTime Components", "summary": "QuickTime codecs for Ogg Vorbis, Speex, Theora, FLAC, and WebM", "version": "0.1.5", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/ae10945a00d196e50135c49ccfabc23f770f456f/icons/xiphqt.png", "author": "Xiph Open Source Community", "downloadCount": 1155, "tags": ["quicktime", "codec", "ogg", "vorbis", "speex", "theora", "flac"]}
