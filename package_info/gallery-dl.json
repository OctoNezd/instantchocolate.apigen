{"description": "*gallery-dl* is a command-line program to download image galleries and\ncollections from several image hosting sites (see [Supported\nSites](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/blob/master/docs/supportedsites.md)).\nIt is a cross-platform tool with many configuration options and powerful\n[filenaming\ncapabilities](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/blob/master/docs/formatting.md).\n\n[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/gallery-dl.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/gallery-dl/)\n[![build](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/workflows/tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/actions)\n[![gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/gallery-dl/main.svg)](https://gitter.im/gallery-dl/main)\n\n## Optional\n\n-   [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/): Pixiv Ugoira to WebM conversion\n-   [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) or\n    [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/): Video\n    downloads\n\t\n# Usage\n\nTo use *gallery-dl* simply call it with the URLs you wish to download\nimages from:\n\n``` bash\ngallery-dl [OPTION]... URL...\n```\n\nSee also `gallery-dl --help`.\n\n## Examples\n\nDownload images; in this case from danbooru via tag search for\n\\'bonocho\\':\n\n``` bash\ngallery-dl \"https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=bonocho\"\n```\n\nGet the direct URL of an image from a site supporting authentication\nwith username & password:\n\n``` bash\ngallery-dl -g -u \"<username>\" -p \"<password>\" \"https://twitter.com/i/web/status/604341487988576256\"\n```\n\nFilter manga chapters by chapter number and language:\n\n``` bash\ngallery-dl --chapter-filter \"10 <= chapter < 20\" -o \"lang=fr\" \"https://mangadex.org/title/59793dd0-a2d8-41a2-9758-8197287a8539\"\n```\n\n| Search a remote resource for URLs and download images from them:\n| (URLs for which no extractor can be found will be silently ignored)\n\n``` bash\ngallery-dl \"r:https://pastebin.com/raw/FLwrCYsT\"\n```\n\nIf a site\\'s address is nonstandard for its extractor, you can prefix\nthe URL with the extractor\\'s name to force the use of a specific\nextractor:\n\n``` bash\ngallery-dl \"tumblr:https://sometumblrblog.example\"\n```\n\n# Configuration\n\nConfiguration files for *gallery-dl* use a JSON-based file format.\n\n| For a (more or less) complete example with options set to their\n  default values, see\n  [gallery-dl.conf](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/blob/master/docs/gallery-dl.conf).\n| For a configuration file example with more involved settings and\n  options, see\n  [gallery-dl-example.conf](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/blob/master/docs/gallery-dl-example.conf).\n| A list of all available configuration options and their descriptions\n  can be found in\n  [configuration.rst](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/blob/master/docs/configuration.rst).\n| \n\n*gallery-dl* searches for configuration files in the following places:\n\n:   -   `%APPDATA%\\gallery-dl\\config.json`\n    -   `%USERPROFILE%\\gallery-dl\\config.json`\n    -   `%USERPROFILE%\\gallery-dl.conf`\n\n    (`%USERPROFILE%` usually refers to the user\\'s home directory, i.e.\n    `C:\\Users\\<username>\\`)\n\t\nValues in later configuration files will override previous ones.\n\nCommand line options will override all related settings in the\nconfiguration file(s), e.g. using `--write-metadata` will enable writing\nmetadata using the default values for all `postprocessors.metadata.*`\nsettings, overriding any specific settings in configuration files.\n\n# WARNING\n### Anti-virus or anti-malware tools and heuristic engines might catch and or label this tool as a virus. This is a false postive due to usage of [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) to pack and ship this software as a single executable without a Python runtime dependency.
