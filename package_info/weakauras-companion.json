{"description": "The WeakAuras Companion is an application built to provide the missing link between Wago and the WeakAuras World of Warcraft addon.\n\nIt enables you to fetch updates to the auras you have installed directly from Wago, without having to manually copy-paste import strings all the time. It also makes sure you don't miss any updates, always keeping you up to date with the latest versions.", "updated": "2024-03-20T20:03:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/weakauras-companion/5.2.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/weakauras-companion/5.2.3", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras-Companion/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "weakauras-companion", "displayName": "WeakAuras Companion", "summary": "WeakAuras Companion App for World of Warcraft.", "version": "5.2.3", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras-Companion/master/public/bigicon.png", "author": "WeakAuras", "downloadCount": 2451, "tags": ["world-of-warcraft", "weakauras", "addon"]}
