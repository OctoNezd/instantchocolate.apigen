{"description": "The Windows NT and Windows 2000 Resource Kits come with a number of command-line tools that help you administer your Windows NT/2K systems. Over time, I've grown a collection of similar tools, including some not included in the Resource Kits. What sets these tools apart is that they all allow you to manage remote systems as well as the local one. The first tool in the suite was PsList, a tool that lets you view detailed information about processes, and the suite is continually growing. The \"Ps\" prefix in PsList relates to the fact that the standard UNIX process listing command-line tool is named \"ps\", so I've adopted this prefix for all the tools in order to tie them together into a suite of tools named PsTools.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pstools/1.2012.04.12", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pstools/1.2012.04.12", "licenseUrl": "http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb469936", "packageName": "pstools", "displayName": "PsTools", "summary": "PsTools - File and Disk Utilities to manage local and remote Windows systems.", "version": "1.2012.04.12", "icon": "", "author": "Mark Russinovich", "downloadCount": 293505, "tags": ["pstools", "psexec", "file", "disk", "utilities", "tools"]}
