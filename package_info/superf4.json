{"description": "SuperF4 kills the foreground program when you press Ctrl+Alt+F4.\nThis is different from when you press Alt+F4.\nWhen you press Alt+F4, the program can refuse to quit.\nWindows only asks the program to quit, and lets it decide for itself what to do.\n\nYou can also kill a program by pressing Win+F4 and then clicking the window with your mouse cursor.\nYou can press escape or the right mouse button to exit this mode without killing a program.\n\nSome games have anti-keylogger protection, which may prevent SuperF4 from working (it can't detect when you press Ctrl+Alt+F4).\nYou can enable TimerCheck to use an alternate detection method.", "updated": "2024-03-23T20:48:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/superf4/1.4.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/superf4/1.4.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/stefansundin/superf4/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "superf4", "displayName": "SuperF4", "summary": "Kill programs instantly with Ctrl+Alt+F4.
