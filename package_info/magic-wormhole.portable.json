{"description": "Get things from one computer to another, safely.\n\nThis package provides a library and a command-line tool named wormhole, which makes it possible to get arbitrary-sized files and directories (or short pieces of text) from one computer to another. The two endpoints are identified by using identical \"wormhole codes\": in general, the sending machine generates and displays the code, which must then be typed into the receiving machine.\n\nThe codes are short and human-pronounceable, using a phonetically-distinct wordlist. The receiving side offers tab-completion on the codewords, so usually only a few characters must be typed. Wormhole codes are single-use and do not need to be memorized.", "updated": "2024-03-23T21:48:43Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/magic-wormhole.portable/0.13.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/magic-wormhole.portable/0.13.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "magic-wormhole.portable", "displayName": "Magic Wormhole (Portable)", "summary": "Get things from one computer to another, safely.", "version": "0.13.0", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/aquacash5/magic-wormhole-exe/main/logo.png", "author": "aquacash5, vaporwave9, warner", "downloadCount": 5856, "tags": ["filetransfer"]}
