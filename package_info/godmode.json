{"description": "---\n\n### [choco://godmode](choco://godmode)\nTo use choco:// protocol URLs, install [(unofficial) choco:// Protocol support ](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-protocol-support)\n\n---\n\nThe Windows Master Control Panel shortcut, labeled All Tasks and also called Windows God Mode by bloggers and All Tasks folder by at least one Microsoft developer,[1] is a short-cut to access various control settings in Windows Vista and later operating systems. By creating a folder with a certain name, users have access to all of the operating system's control panels from within a single folder. The hack was published outside of Microsoft documentation in 2007[2] and gained popularity when the name God Mode was used by bloggers. Variations of the same method can access different settings, and have also been called \u201cGod Mode\u201d folders.\n\n#### There is no software to install, this simply creates the GodMode icon on the current users's desktop.\n\t\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/godmode/readme.md)**\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Click here to [Patreon-ize](https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3) the package maintainer.**\n\n---", "updated": "2024-03-20T13:33:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/godmode/1.0.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/godmode/1.0.1", "licenseUrl": "https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/mylogos/not_applicable.png", "packageName": "godmode", "displayName": "GodMode", "summary": "A short-cut to access various control settings in Windows Vista and later operating systems.", "version": "1.0.1", "icon": "https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/godmode/godmode_icon.png", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 2585, "tags": ["godmode", "god", "mode", "control", "panel"]}
