On a practical side, Factor has a [full-featured library](https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-vocab-index.html), supports many different platforms, and has been extensively documented.\n\nThe implementation is [fully compiled](https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Factor/Optimizing%20compiler) for performance, while still supporting [interactive development](https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Factor/Interactive%20development). Factor applications are portable between all common platforms. Factor can [deploy stand-alone applications](https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Factor/Deployment) on all platforms.
