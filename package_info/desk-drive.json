{"description": "Desk Drive solves a really annoying problem. You pop a USB thumb drive or DVD into your computer and then you have to open Window's Explorer and find the mapped drive or folder. Desk Drive adds a desktop icon pointing to the drive automatically. Remove the media and the shortcut goes away. Brilliantly simple and effective. Desk Drive sits quietly in the system tray. Configuration is just a click away and allows you to specify which types of media to monitor. So simple, it just works.", "updated": "2024-03-22T07:33:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/desk-drive/2.1.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/desk-drive/2.1.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/mike-ward/DeskDrive/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "desk-drive", "displayName": "Desk Drive", "summary": "Automatic drive/media shortcuts for your desktop", "version": "2.1.1", "icon": "https://i.imgur.com/XFbmihY.png", "author": "Mike Ward", "downloadCount": 1224, "tags": ["windows", "desktop", "usb", "utility"]}
