{"description": "Free open-source disk encryption software for Windows 7/Vista/XP, Mac OS X, and Linux.\n\n### Abandonware\nTrueCrypt is currently unmaintained (since May 2014), which may have security implications. The [original website](http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/) and forums have been taken offline. For more information, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#End_of_life_announcement) and the [community website](https://truecrypt.ch/) for plans on continuing development under a different name as required by the [TrueCrypt license v3.0](https://github.com/FreeApophis/TrueCrypt/blob/master/License.txt).\n\n### Security audit\n__Dec 2013:__ Prior to TrueCrypt developers abandoning the software, its security was brought to question and a public audit was called for and successfully funded on a public [crowd-funding website](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-truecrypt-audit). \n__May 2014:__ The anonymous TrueCrypt developers announce no further development of TrueCrypt and recommend [Windows users](http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/) to migrate to BitLocker, the closed source encryption available in certain versions of Microsoft Windows and [Mac OSX users](http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/OtherPlatforms.html) migrate to OS' native encryption tools in Disk Utility.\n__Apr 2015__: The security [audit is completed](http://istruecryptauditedyet.com/) of TrueCrypt version 7.1a and published on https://opencryptoaudit.org/. The entirety of the final report is available as a [PDF](https://opencryptoaudit.org/reports/TrueCrypt_Phase_II_NCC_OCAP_final.pdf). An excerpt from that report follows:\n\n> The Open Crypto Audit Project engaged Cryptography Services (CS) to perform a scoped engagement\non portions of TrueCrypt's cryptographic implementations and use. This review was narrowly scoped\nto specific aspects of the application, and was time-boxed to an engagement length that was deemed\nsufficient to give adequate coverage of the components in place.\n> [...]\n> CS identified four (4) issues, and none led to a complete bypass of confidentiality\nin common usage scenarios. The standard workflow of creating a volume and making use of it\nwas reviewed, and no significant flaws were found that would impact it.\n\n### Version 7.2\nConcurrent to the May 2014 announcement of abandoning the project and recommending users migrate to other software, version __7.2__ was released as a closed source installer of TrueCrypt intended for migrating encrypted TrueCrypt containers to other encryption software.\n\nDue to the unexpected and suspicious announcement and lack of information detailing any changes or fixes made to the installer, it is generally advised __not__ to install version 7.2 for cautious users.\n\n### Version 7.1a\nAlthough open source version 7.1a was released 7 February 2012, no critical security issues are known and it has been found reliable and stable.\n\nThis package installs version __7.1a__\n\n### Community\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TrueCryptNext)", "updated": "2024-03-23T17:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/truecrypt/7.1.20150620", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/truecrypt/7.1.20150620", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/FreeApophis/TrueCrypt/blob/master/License.txt", "packageName": "truecrypt", "displayName": "TrueCrypt", "summary": "Free, open-source, cross-platform, disk encryption software", "version": "7.1.20150620", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/d909eae346c6edf23ab67464166226ba659ac1ee/icons/truecrypt.png", "author": "TrueCrypt Developers Association", "downloadCount": 21991, "tags": ["security", "privacy", "encryption", "aes", "serpent", "twofish", "ripemd-160", "sha-512", "whirlpool", "abandonware", "unattended"]}
