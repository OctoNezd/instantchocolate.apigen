Istio's control plane provides an abstraction\nlayer over the underlying cluster management platform, such as Kubernetes.\n\nIstio is composed of these components:\n\n- **Envoy** - Sidecar proxies per microservice to handle ingress/egress traffic\n   between services in the cluster and from a service to external\n   services. The proxies form a _secure microservice mesh_ providing a rich\n   set of functions like discovery, rich layer-7 routing, circuit breakers,\n   policy enforcement and telemetry recording/reporting\n   functions.\n\n  > Note: The service mesh is not an overlay network. It\n  > simplifies and enhances how microservices in an application talk to each\n  > other over the network provided by the underlying platform.\n\n- **Mixer** - Central component that is leveraged by the proxies and microservices\n   to enforce policies such as authorization, rate limits, quotas, authentication, request\n   tracing and telemetry collection.\n\n- **Pilot** - A component responsible for configuring the proxies at runtime.\n\n- **Citadel** - A centralized component responsible for certificate issuance and rotation.\n\n- **Citadel Agent** - A per-node component responsible for certificate issuance and rotation.\n\n- **Galley**- Central component for validating, ingesting, aggregating, transforming and distributing config within Istio.\n\nIstio currently supports Kubernetes and Consul-based environments. We plan support for additional platforms such as\nCloud Foundry, and Mesos in the near future.\n\n**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package.
