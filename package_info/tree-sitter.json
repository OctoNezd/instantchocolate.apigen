It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be:\n\n- **General** enough to parse any programming language\n- **Fast** enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor\n- **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors\n- **Dependency-free** so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C) can be embedded in any application\n\n## Links\n\n- [Documentation](https://tree-sitter.github.io)\n- [Rust binding](lib/binding_rust/README.md)\n- [WASM binding](lib/binding_web/README.md)\n- [Command-line interface](cli/README.md)", "updated": "2024-03-23T23:03:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/tree-sitter/0.22.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/tree-sitter/0.22.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "tree-sitter", "displayName": "tree-sitter", "summary": "Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library.
