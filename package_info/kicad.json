{"description": "# KiCad EDA\n\n### Schematic Capture\nWith the schematic editor you can create your design without limit; there are no paywalls to unlock features. An official library for schematic symbols and a built-in schematic symbol editor help you get started quickly with your designs.\n\n### PCB Layout\nMake professional PCB layouts with up to 32 copper layers. KiCad now has a push and shove router which is capable of routing differential pairs and interactively tuning trace lengths.\n\n### 3D Viewer\nKiCad includes a 3D viewer which you can use to inspect your design in an interactive canvas. You can rotate and pan around to inspect details that are difficult to inspect on a 2D view. Multiple rendering options allow you to modify the aesthetic appearance of the board or to hide and show features for easier inspection.\n\n## Maintainer's Note\n\nI produce and maintain Chocolatey packages in my spare time, for free.
