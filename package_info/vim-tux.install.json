{"description": "A highly configurable text editor for efficiently creating and changing any kind of text (tux build).\n\nVanilla build of vim, compiled with all features enabled. 'Right click > edit with vim' support included. Vim and gVim launchers are added to PATH.\n\n## Package Parameters\n\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n* `/InstallDir`       - Install to a specific location.\n* `/InstallPopUp`     - Install into the context menu \"Edit with gVim\", powered by `GVimExt.dll`.\n* `/RestartExplorer`  - Kill explorer.exe before each update to free up the in-use `GVimExt.dll`.\n* `/NoCreateBatFiles` - Do not create batch files in `C:\\Windows` (vim.bat, vimdiff.bat, etc).\n\nFor example `choco install vim-tux.portable --package-parameters=\"'/InstallDir=C:\\MyFolder /InstallPopUp /RestartExplorer'\"`\n\nPlease visit the [official site](https://tuxproject.de/projects/vim/), [docs](https://www.vim.org/docs.php) and [mailing list](http://www.vim.org/maillist.php) for more information.\nBuild provided by TuxProject.de - consider donating to help support their server costs.\n\n## Notes\n\n* The [Vim mailing list Url](http://www.vim.org/maillist.php) causes Package Validation to regularly fail, so it was removed from the metadata.\n* This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s), to let the know the package is no longer updating, using:\n    * The 'Contact Maintainers' link on the package page, or\n    * The 'Package Source' link on the package page and raising an issue.\n\n### Antivirus Detections\n\n* The x86 edition was removed from the package due to consistently high AV detections stopping the package from being approved.\n* The embedded binaries are regularly flagged by antivirus engines. Please see these GitHub issues for information: [1](https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/2933), [2](https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/2961), [3](https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/issues/36), [4](https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/issues/53) and [5](https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/2895). If in doubt, do not install the package.\n* If you find missing versions, please check the 'Version History' section on the package page. If the versions are rejected it is likely due to very high AV counts.", "updated": "2024-03-23T23:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vim-tux.install/9.1.193", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vim-tux.install/9.1.193", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "vim-tux.install", "displayName": "Vim Tux (Install)", "summary": "A highly configurable text editor for efficiently creating and changing any kind of text (tux build).
