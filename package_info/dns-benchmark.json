When the Benchmark is started in its default configuration, it identifies all DNS nameservers the user's system is currently configured to use and adds them to its built-in list of publicly available \u201calternative\u201d nameservers. Each DNS nameserver in the benchmark list is carefully \u201ccharacterized\u201d to determine its suitability \u2014 to you \u2014 for your use as a DNS resolver. This characterization includes testing each nameserver for its \u201credirection\u201d behavior: whether it returns an error for a bad domain request, or redirects a user's web browser to a commercial marketing-oriented page. While such behavior may be acceptable to some users, others may find this objectionable.\n\nThe point made above about the suitability \u2014 to you \u2014 of candidate nameservers is a crucial one, since everything is about where you are located relative to the nameservers being tested. You might see someone talking about how fast some specific DNS nameservers are for them, but unless you share their location there's absolutely no guarantee that the same nameservers would perform as well for you. ONLY by benchmarking DNS resolvers from your own location, as this DNS Benchmark does, can you compare nameserver performance where it matters . . . right where you're computer is.\nWhen the benchmark is run, the performance and apparent reliability of the DNS nameservers the system is currently using, plus all of the working nameservers on the Benchmark's built-in list of alternative nameservers are compared with each other.\n\nResults are continuously displayed and updated while the benchmark is underway, with a dynamically sorted and scaled bar chart, and a tabular chart display showing the cached, uncached and \u201cdotcom\u201d DNS lookup performance of each nameserver. These values are determined by carefully querying each nameserver for the IP addresses of the top 50 most popular domain names on the Internet and also by querying for nonexistent domains.\n\nOnce the benchmark finishes, the results are heuristically and statistically analyzed to present a comprehensive yet simplified and understandable English-language summary of all important findings and conclusions. Based upon these results, users may choose to change the usage order of their system's own resolvers, or, if alternative public nameservers offer superior performance or features compared with the nameservers currently being used, to switch to one or more alternative nameservers.\n\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/dns-benchmark/readme.md)**\n\n___\n\nClick here to [Patreon-ize](https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3) the package maintainer.\n___", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:03:53Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dns-benchmark/1.3.6668.20190425", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/dns-benchmark/1.3.6668.20190425", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "dns-benchmark", "displayName": "DNS Benchmark", "summary": "Domain Name Speed Benchmark", "version": "1.3.6668.20190425", "icon": "https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/dns-benchmark/dns-benchmark_icon.png", "author": "Steve Gibson", "downloadCount": 6274, "tags": ["domain", "name", "server", "dns", "speed", "benchmark", "steve", "gibson", "portable"]}
