{"description": "###WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?\n\nThe average person probably doesn't need this. This package is primarily for sysadmins who have to constantly configure computers and make sure they are all the same. Sure, there are other methods of doing these same functions. You can manually change the settings, it doesn't take that long. You could use GPO or a configuration manager, but not everyone has access to these tools - but you have access to Chocolatey! I put Chocolatey on just about every box I touch... so I made this Chocolatey package for (almost) super simple configuration, well, really so I can add it to my setup scripts. Installing this package is probably too complex for the average person, but it should be of good use to those who script or automate a lot of installs using Chocolatey. This is part of a series of \"-winconfig\" packages for configuration automation. Others include [desktopicons-winconfig](https://chocolatey.org/packages/desktopicons-winconfig), [homepages-winconfig](https://chocolatey.org/packages/homepages-winconfig), and [taskbar-winconfig](https://chocolatey.org/packages/taskbar-winconfig)\n\n###FEATURES:\n* Toggle Windows Explorer to show file extensions YES/NO\n* Toggle Windows Explorer to show full path in title bar YES/NO\n* Toggle Windows Explorer to show hidden files YES/NO/ALL (system files)\n* Toggle Windows Explorer to show check boxes YES/NO\n* Toggle Windows Explorer to show encrypted files in color YES/NO\n* Toggle Windows Explorer to show the preview pane YES/NO\n* Toggle Windows Explorer to show the details pane YES/NO\n* Toggle Windows Explorer to show drives with no media YES/NO\n* Toggle Windows Explorer file view choices\n* Toggle Windows Explorer use of Sharing Wizard YES/NO\n\n###INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou NEED to install **explorer-winconfig** with package parameters or it will do nothing.
