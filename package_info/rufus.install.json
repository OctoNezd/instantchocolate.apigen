{"description": "## Rufus (Install)\nRufus is a utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash drives, such as USB\nkeys/pendrives, memory sticks, etc.\n\nIt can be especially useful for cases where:\n\n* you need to create USB installation media from bootable ISOs (Windows, Linux, UEFI, etc.)\n* you need to work on a system that doesn't have an OS installed\n* you need to flash a BIOS or other firmware from DOS\n* you want to run a low-level utility\n\nDespite its small size, Rufus provides everything you need!\n\nOh, and Rufus is fast. For instance it's about twice as fast as UNetbootin, Universal USB Installer\nor Windows 7 USB download tool, on the creation of a Windows 7 USB installation drive from an ISO.\nIt is also marginally faster on the creation of Linux bootable USB from ISOs.\n\n[FAQ](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/FAQ)\n\n### Package-specific issue\nIf this package isn't up-to-date for some days, [Create an issue](https://github.com/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages/issues/new/choose)\n\nSupport the package maintainer and [![Patreon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@d15c4e19c709e7148588d4523ffc6dd3cd3c7e5e/icons/patreon.png)](https://www.patreon.com/tunisiano)", "updated": "2024-03-23T05:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rufus.install/3.13", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/rufus.install/3.13", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html", "packageName": "rufus.install", "displayName": "Rufus (Install appx Windows 10)", "summary": "Create bootable USB drives from Windows and Linux images", "version": "3.13", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@923fb43c13ab879f96b2b5018e617849451fb03b/icons/rufus.install.png", "author": "Pete \"Akeo\" Batard", "downloadCount": 44928, "tags": ["liveusb", "bootdisk", "linux", "windows"]}
