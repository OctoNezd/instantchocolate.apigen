{"description": "Quickly write your own .NET Code Generator via T4 Text-Templates (.tt-Files) with Intelli-Sense & Syntax-Highlighting. \n\ttangible T4 Editor comes with UML-Style modeling tools and can generate from diagrams, database schemas, xml, word, excel sources, or any other data source. \n\tMicrosoft T4 looks and smells like ASP.NET - it is simple! T4 is used in ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework and DSL Tools. \n\tThe Microsoft T4 Generation Engine is already built into Visual Studio, however Visual Studio does not provide an Code-Editor for it. \n\tThat is why we created the tangible T4 Editor for Visual Studio. You can now accelerate your projects by adopting Microsoft T4 today and generate the code you need directly from diagrams, \n\tdatabase schemas, xml files or other sources - Write less, achieve more.", "updated": "2024-03-19T11:18:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/tangible-t4-vs2017/2.4.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/tangible-t4-vs2017/2.4.0", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "tangible-t4-vs2017", "displayName": "tangible T4 Editor plus modeling tools for VS 2017", "summary": "T4 editor for Visual Studio 2017", "version": "2.4.0", "icon": "http://cdn.rawgit.com/flcdrg/au-packages/master/tangible-t4-vs2017/icons/tangible-t4-vs2017.png", "author": "tangible engineering GmbH", "downloadCount": 1174, "tags": ["t4", "templates", "visualstudio", "admin", "codegeneration", "vs2017"]}
