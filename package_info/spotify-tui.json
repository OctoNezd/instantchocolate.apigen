{"description": "# Spotify TUI\nA Spotify client for the terminal written in Rust.\n\n## Connecting to Spotify\u2019s API\n`spotify-tui` needs to connect to Spotify\u2019s API in order to find music by name, play tracks etc.\n\nInstructions on how to set this up will be shown when you first run the app.\n\n## Usage\nThe binary is named `spt`.\n\nRunning `spt` with no arguments will bring up the UI. Press `?` to bring up a help menu that shows currently implemented key events and their actions. There is also a CLI that is able to do most of the stuff the UI does. Use `spt --help` to learn more.\n\nHere are some example to get you excited.\n```\nspt --completions zsh # Prints shell completions for zsh to stdout (bash, power-shell and more are supported)\n\nspt play --name \"Your Playlist\" --playlist --random # Plays a random song from \"Your Playlist\"\nspt play --name \"A cool song\" --track # Plays 'A cool song'\n\nspt playback --like --shuffle # Likes the current song and toggles shuffle mode\nspt playback --toggle # Plays/pauses the current playback\n\nspt list --liked --limit 50 # See your liked songs (50 is the max limit)\n\n# Looks for 'An even cooler song' and gives you the '{name} from {album}' of up to 30 matches\nspt search \"An even cooler song\" --tracks --format \"%t from %b\" --limit 30\n\n```\n\n### For more information about Spotify TUI see the official [README.md](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/blob/master/README.md).", "updated": "2024-03-22T14:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/spotify-tui/0.25.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/spotify-tui/0.25.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "spotify-tui", "displayName": "Spotify TUI", "summary": "A Spotify client for the terminal written in Rust.", "version": "0.25.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jakublevy/chocopkgs/icons/spotify-tui.png", "author": "Alexander Keliris", "downloadCount": 974, "tags": ["spotify", "client", "commandline", "tui", "cross-platform"]}
