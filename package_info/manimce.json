{"description": "Manim is an animation engine written in Python primarily used to create explanatory math videos such as those of [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw). It allows for the creation of precise animations programmatically. For more info, [see the GitHub repo](https://github.com/manimcommunity/manim).\n\nThis package aims to simplify the historically painful process of setting up Manim on Windows. After installation you can execute your animation scripts with `manim <file>.py`.\nFile any issues at https://github.com/manimcommunity/manim/issues\n\n**NOTE:** This package  installs the [community version](https://github.com/manimcommunity/manim) of manim, which is different from https://github.com/3b1b/manim, mainly because it is developed by a team of volunteer developers. This software is currently under development and may be out of date, unstable, buggy, or not even run at all when installed.\n\nThis **installs** manim using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) with its dependencies.\n\n**NOTE:** This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/manimce/0.18.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/manimce/0.18.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/blob/master/LICENSE.community", "packageName": "manimce", "displayName": "Manim Install", "summary": "A community-maintained Python framework for creating mathematical animations.", "version": "0.18.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ManimCommunity/manim/logo/light/transparent_background.png", "author": "Manim Contributors", "downloadCount": 47145, "tags": ["manim", "python", "animation", "math"]}
