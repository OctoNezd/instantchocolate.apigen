This enables new fast `ad hoc` workflows.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/extraterm.portable/screenshot5.gif)\n\nOr you can edit the command output directly in place and execute the selection with Ctrl+Shift+Enter.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/extraterm.portable/screenshot6.gif)\n\n### Easy Downloads and Uploads\nThe shell integration makes uploading and downloading files easy without requiring additional tools. It works transparently across SSH too.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/extraterm.portable/screenshot7.png)\n\n### Compatible\nBackwards compatibility with the decades of existing terminal based applications and your decades of workflows and habits is very important.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/extraterm.portable/screenshot8.gif)", "updated": "2024-03-09T15:48:18Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/extraterm.portable/0.70.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/extraterm.portable/0.70.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sedwards2009/extraterm/v0.42.2/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "extraterm.portable", "displayName": "Extraterm (Portable)", "summary": "The swiss army chainsaw of terminal emulators", "version": "0.70.0", "icon": "", "author": "Simon Edwards", "downloadCount": 3956, "tags": ["extraterm.portable", "terminal", "emulator"]}
