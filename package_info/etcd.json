{"description": "**etcd** is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to\nbe accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader elections during network\npartitions and can tolerate machine failure, even in the leader node.\n\n## Features\n\n* **Simple interface** Read and write values using standard HTTP tools, such as curl\n* **Key-value storage** Store data in hierarchically organized directories, as in a standard filesystem\n* **Watch for changes** Watch specific keys or directories for changes and react to changes in values\n* Optional SSL client certificate authentication\n* Benchmarked at 1000s of writes/s per instance\n* Optional TTLs for keys expiration\n* Properly distributed via Raft protocol  \n\n## Package Parameters\n\n* The package will pass package parameters to the etcd service  \nExample: `choco install etcd -y --params=\"-discovery https://discovery.etcd.io/tokengoeshere\"`\n\n## Notes\n\n* This package installs **etcd** as a service, and makes **etcdctl** (the command line client) available in the path\n* The service is managed with NSSM, you can change the service parameters easily by running `nssm edit etcd`\n* Windows support is limited to 64-bit systems\n* Originally packaged by Robert Labrie (https://github.com/robertlabrie)", "updated": "2024-03-22T05:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/etcd/3.5.12", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/etcd/3.5.12", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/LICENSE", "packageName": "etcd", "displayName": "etcd (Install)", "summary": "etcd is a distributed, consistent key-value store for shared configuration and service discovery", "version": "3.5.12", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages@c681fe2d8274d648911c90a5cfa63b43e4663013/icons/etcd.png", "author": "etcd Authors", "downloadCount": 29704, "tags": ["etcd", "configuration", "cli", "cross-platform", "foss"]}
