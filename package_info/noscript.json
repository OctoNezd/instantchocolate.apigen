{"description": "The NoScript Firefox extension provides extra protection for Firefox, Seamonkey and other mozilla-based browsers: this free, open source add-on allows JavaScript, Java, Flash and other plugins to be executed only by trusted web sites of your choice (e.g. your online bank).\n\nNoScript also provides the most powerful anti-XSS and anti-Clickjacking protection ever available in a browser.\n\nNoScript's unique whitelist based pre-emptive script blocking approach prevents exploitation of security vulnerabilities (known and even not known yet!) with no loss of functionality...\n\nYou can enable JavaScript, Java and plugin execution for sites you trust with a simple left-click on the NoScript status bar icon (look at the picture), or using the contextual menu, for easier operation in popup statusbar-less windows.\nWatch the \"Block scripts in Firefox\" video by cnet.\n\nStaying safe has never been so easy!\n\n***Note:*** this addon will be installed for all profiles. You can not remove the addons through Firefox - only manually by removing the folder from `\\extensions` or by uninstalling the package. You will have to confirm in Firefox if you want to enable the addon (thats a security feature of Firefox).\nThe package should always install the newest version, independent of the package version. Subsequent updates should be dealt with automatically by Firefox.", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:33:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/noscript/2.9.0.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/noscript/2.9.0.2", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.de/documents/gpl-2.0.de.html", "packageName": "noscript", "displayName": "NoScript", "summary": "The NoScript Firefox extension provides extra protection for Firefox, Seamonkey and other mozilla-based browsers: this free, open source add-on allows JavaScript, Java, Flash and other plugins to be executed only by trusted web sites of your choice (e.g. your online bank).", "version": "2.9.0.2", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/aronovgj/chocolatey/8340261214dfaac6e32bfcccf6ebdebed14703a1/icons/noscript.png", "author": "Giorgio Maone", "downloadCount": 3888, "tags": ["noscript", "java", "javascript", "block", "ads", "script"]}
