{"description": "dbachecks is a framework created by and for SQL Server pros who need to validate their environments. Basically, we all share similar checklists and mostly just the server names and RPO/RTO/etc change.\n\nThis open source module allows us to crowd-source our checklists using Pester tests. Such checks include:\n\n* Backups are being performed\n* Identity columns are not about to max out\n* Servers have access to backup paths\n* Database integrity checks are being performed and corruption does not exist\n* Disk space is not about to run out\n* All enabled jobs have succeeded\n\nHave questions about development? Please visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/dbachecks/wiki). **Anyone developing this module should visit that Wiki page (after fully reading this readme) for a brief overview**.\n\n_**NOTE: This module requires a minimum of PowerShell v4.**_\n\n**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package.
