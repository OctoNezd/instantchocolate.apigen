{"description": "WMI Explorer is a utility intended to provide the ability to browse and view WMI namespaces/classes/instances/properties in a single pane of view and is inspired by the PowerShell based WMI Explorer written by Marc.\n\tAs someone who works with Configuration Manager (SCCM), I spend a lot of time in wbemtest trying to find things which is very time consuming. I started this project with the intention to combine the features of currently available WMI Explorers, and to make it easier and quicker to find what you're looking for in WMI.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/wmiexplorer/2.0.0.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/wmiexplorer/2.0.0.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/vinaypamnani/wmie2/blob/master/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "wmiexplorer", "displayName": "WMI Explorer (Install)", "summary": "WMI Explorer is a utility intended to provide the ability to browse and view WMI namespaces/classes/instances/properties in a single pane of view.", "version": "2.0.0.2", "icon": "", "author": "Vinay Pamnani", "downloadCount": 29016, "tags": ["wmiexplorer", "wmi", "windows", "cim", "explorer", "vinay", "pamnani"]}
