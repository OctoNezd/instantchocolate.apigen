{"description": "Show users logged on to a system.\n\nYou can determine who is using resources on your local computer with the \"net\" command (\"net session\"), however, there is no built-in way to determine who is using the resources of a remote computer. In addition, NT comes with no tools to see who is logged onto a computer, either locally or remotely. PsLoggedOn is an applet that displays both the locally logged on users and users logged on via resources for either the local computer, or a remote one. If you specify a user name instead of a computer, PsLoggedOn searches the computers in the network neighborhood and tells you if the user is currently logged on.\n\n#### Command line usage\n\n__psloggedon__ [__-__] [__-l__] [__-x__] [\\\\\\\\computername | username]\n\n__-__    Displays the supported options and the units of measurement used for output values.\n\n__-l__    Shows only local logons instead of both local and network resource logons.\n\n__-x__    Don't show logon times.\n\n__\\\\\\\\computername__    Specifies the name of the computer for which to list logon information.\n\n__username__    If you specify a user name _PsLoggedOn_ searches the network for computers to which that user is logged on. This is useful if you want to ensure that a particular user is not logged on when you are about to change their user profile configuration.", "updated": "2024-03-14T12:18:34Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/psloggedon/1.35", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/psloggedon/1.35", "licenseUrl": "https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb469936", "packageName": "psloggedon", "displayName": "PsLoggedOn", "summary": "Show users logged on to a system", "version": "1.35", "icon": "", "author": "Mark Russinovich", "downloadCount": 1425, "tags": ["login", "tools", "sysinternals"]}
