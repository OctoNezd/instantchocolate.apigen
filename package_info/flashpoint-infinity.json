{"description": "BlueMaxima's Flashpoint is a webgame preservation project dedicated to preserving as many experiences from web\nplatforms, including but not limited to Adobe Flash,  as possible, so that they aren't lost to time.\n\nFlashpoint utilizes a strong selection of open-source software. By combining the power of Apache, a custom-built\nlauncher, and our own application called the Flashpoint Secure Player, we can play web-based media in a quick,\nuser-friendly environment without leaving permanent changes or security holes on your computer.\n\nFlashpoint Infinity is a smaller distribution of the Flashpoint Launcher (FPL) that allows you to download and play\ncontent at will.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@61675e066fbd84d13a0e55342c158cfb39b1e211/automatic/flashpoint-infinity/screenshot.png))\n\n## Package Parameters\n\nThe following package parameter can be set:\n\n* `/AddToDesktop` - this puts a shortcut on your desktop to Flashpoint.\n\nThese parameters can be passed to the installer with the use of `--params`.\nFor example: `--params \"/AddToDesktop\"`.\n\nTo have Chocolatey remember parameters on upgrade, be sure to set `choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`.\n\n## Notes\n\n* You may be prompted by the Windows Firewall to allow the Apache HTTP Server on first execution\n* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).\n  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-22T19:19:16Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/flashpoint-infinity/10.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/flashpoint-infinity/10.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/FlashpointProject", "packageName": "flashpoint-infinity", "displayName": "Flashpoint Infinity - BlueMaxima's Flashpoint Infinity Distrbution", "summary": "Run applications from the Flashpoint project with on-demand download and installation", "version": "10.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@71d741b5e9171786eff61aea63d42c7c6ef286c6/icons/flashpoint.png", "author": "Flashpoint Contributors", "downloadCount": 1153, "tags": ["flashpoint", "infinity", "flashpoint-infinity", "flash", "preservation", "sandbox", "electron", "bluepoint"]}
