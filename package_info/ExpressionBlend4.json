{"description": "Microsoft Expression Blend 4 includes new built-in behaviors, which are reusable pieces of packaged code that can be dragged onto any object, and then fine-tuned by changing their properties. Behaviors allow you to add interactivity to your applications without having to write any code. The Behavior API consists of three core classes: Trigger, Action and Behavior. This SDK explores how to write each of these components, and contains a few code samples to help you get started. Programming reference topics are provided for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). For more how-to and overview information about behaviors in Expression Blend, see the Expression Blend User Guide, available when you install Expression Blend 4. \n\nThe Expression Blend SDK also contains the following redistributable components:\n\n* SketchFlow Player\n* Custom VSM for Fluid Layout\n* Font Embedding enhancements\n* Effects and Transition Effects\n* Shapes\n\nThe Expression Blend SDK is required to edit an Expression Blend 4 project that uses any of these components if Expression Blend 4 is not installed.", "updated": "2024-03-09T15:18:23Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ExpressionBlend4/2.0.20525", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ExpressionBlend4/2.0.20525", "licenseUrl": "http://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/get-started/install/License.aspx", "packageName": "ExpressionBlend4", "displayName": "Microsoft Expression Blend Software Development Kit (SDK) for .NET 4", "summary": "The Expression Blend Software Development Kit (SDK) contains redistributable components that you need when building Expression Blend 4 applications.", "version": "2.0.20525", "icon": "", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 3134, "tags": ["expression", "blend", "expressionblend", "expressionblend4", "blend4", "sdk", "microsoft"]}
