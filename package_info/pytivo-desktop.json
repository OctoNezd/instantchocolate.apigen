My name is Dan and I'm a moderator over on TiVo Community as well as a software developer for VideoReDo. I have recently forked wmcbrine's version of pyTivo and built it into a Windows install package that includes a more user friendly UI and does NOT require python to be installed on the users machine. Everything in the package is compiled into standard exe files. I've used pyinstaller for the python code and electron for my Angular based UI. If anyone is interested it can be downloaded for free here.. \n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/pytivo-desktop/readme.md)**", "updated": "2024-03-19T14:18:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pytivo-desktop/1.6.16.0020180601", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pytivo-desktop/1.6.16.0020180601", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "pytivo-desktop", "displayName": "pyTivo Desktop (Install)", "summary": "pyTivo Desktop - Download shows from, and share music, photos and videos with, your TiVo\u00a9 DVR", "version": "1.6.16.0020180601", "icon": "http://www.pytivodesktop.com/assets/img/logo.png", "author": "Dan Haddix", "downloadCount": 3445, "tags": ["pytivo", "wmcbrine", "tivo", "home", "theatre", "video", "streaming", "server", "haddix", "admin"]}
