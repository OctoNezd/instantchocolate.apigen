{"description": "vvvv itself is not open source, but it offers different open interfaces for people to write their own nodes:\nPlugins - most general interface for writing multipurpose nodes\nFreeframes - video effects/analysis nodes\nEffects - vertex- and pixelshader\nModules - reusable vvvv-patches\nVST - audio effects/analysis nodes\nMany users share their work mostly under the LGPL opensource license. Those nodes, not being part of the main executable are called addons and their sources are being hosted on github.\nAll contributed addons are available via a separately downloadable addonpack in order to allow independent release cycles of the main vvvv application and user submitted content.", "updated": "2024-03-17T13:48:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vvvv-addonpack.x86/29.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vvvv-addonpack.x86/29.2", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html", "packageName": "vvvv-addonpack.x86", "displayName": "vvvv addonpack (32 bit)", "summary": "Convenience pack of most available vvvv addons", "version": "29.2", "icon": "http://vvvv.org/sites/all/themes/vvvv/css/img/logo.png", "author": "vvvv community,  vvvv group", "downloadCount": 2249, "tags": ["vvvv", "addons", "node", "graphicall", "programming"]}
