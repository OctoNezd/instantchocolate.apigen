{"description": "BIND is open source software that implements the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols for the Internet. It is a reference implementation of those protocols, but it is also production-grade software, suitable for use in high-volume and high-reliability applications.  The name BIND stands for \u201cBerkeley Internet Name Domain\u201d, because the software originated in the early 1980s at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nBIND is by far the most widely used DNS software on the Internet, providing a robust and stable platform on top of which organizations can build distributed computing systems with the knowledge that those systems are fully compliant with published DNS standards.\n\n**NOTE**: 9.16.x is the last branch of BIND with native Windows support.", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:33:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/bind-toolsonly/9.16.28", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/bind-toolsonly/9.16.28", "licenseUrl": "https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/bind9/-/blob/main/LICENSE", "packageName": "bind-toolsonly", "displayName": "BIND Tools", "summary": "The most widely used Name Server Software.", "version": "9.16.28", "icon": "", "author": "ISC", "downloadCount": 187300, "tags": ["bind", "isc", "dig"]}
