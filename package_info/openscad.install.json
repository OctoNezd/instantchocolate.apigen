{"description": "OpenSCAD is software for creating solid 3D CAD models. \n\tIt is free software and available for Linux/UNIX, Windows and Mac OS X. \n\tUnlike most free software for creating 3D models (such as Blender) it does not focus on the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead on the CAD aspects.\n\tThus it might be the application you are looking for when you are planning\n\tto create 3D models of machine parts but pretty sure is not what you are looking for when you are more interested in creating computer-animated movies.\n\nOpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller.\n Instead it is something like a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object and renders the 3D model from this script file. \n This gives you (the designer) full control over the modelling process and enables you to easily change any step in the modelling process or make designs that are defined by configurable parameters.", "updated": "2024-03-19T22:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/openscad.install/2021.01", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/openscad.install/2021.01", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "openscad.install", "displayName": "OpenSCAD", "summary": "OpenSCAD is a free software application for creating solid 3D CAD (computer-aided design) objects.", "version": "2021.01", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/openscad/openscad/a51718b59b5b7033753a02942c1913c5a75764d8/icons/SCAD.png", "author": "Marius Kintel", "downloadCount": 1479, "tags": ["3D", "CAD", "modelling"]}
