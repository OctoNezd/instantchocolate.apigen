This allows Duplicati to back up the Microsoft Outlook PST file while Outlook is running.\n* Filters, deletion rules, transfer and bandwidth options, etc\n\n### Many Backends\n\nDuplicati works with standard protocols like FTP, SSH, WebDAV as well as popular services like Microsoft OneDrive, Amazon Cloud Drive \" S3, Google Drive, box.com, Mega, hubiC and many others.\n\n### Free software\n\nDuplicati is free software and open source.

You can also use GPG to encrypt your backup.\n\n### Built for online\n\nDuplicati was designed for online backups from scratch. It is not only data efficient but also handles network issues nicely. E.g. interrupted backups can be resumed and Duplicati tests the content of backups regularly. That way broken backups on corrupt storage systems can be detected before it\u2019s too late.\n\n### Web-based user interface\n\nDuplicati is configured by a web interface that runs in any browser (even mobile) and can be accessed - if you like - from anywhere.
