{"description": "Puppet is a flexible, customizable framework available under the Apache 2.0 license designed to help system administrators automate the many repetitive tasks they regularly perform. As a declarative, model-based approach to IT automation, it lets you define the desired state \u2013 or the \u201cwhat\u201d \u2013 of your infrastructure using the Puppet configuration language. Once these configurations are deployed, Puppet automatically installs the necessary packages and starts the related services, and then regularly enforces the desired state. In automating the mundane, Puppet frees you to work on more challenging projects with higher business impact.\n\nPuppet Open Source is the underlying technology for Puppet Enterprise and runs on all major Linux distributions, major Unix platforms like Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX, and Microsoft Windows.\n\nPuppet Agent is an \"All-in-One\" package that installs Puppet, Ruby, Facter, Hiera, MCollective (mco) and supporting code. It is all you need to start using Puppet. See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/install_windows.html for more information.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\nThis is an experimental package. It will overwrite any settings you have in hiera.yaml or environment.conf.\n\n**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is\nout of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and\nlet them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-23T17:18:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/puppet-agent.portable/1.10.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/puppet-agent.portable/1.10.4", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "puppet-agent.portable", "displayName": "Puppet Agent (Portable)", "summary": "Puppet is IT automation software that helps system administrators manage infrastructure throughout its lifecycle, from provisioning and configuration to patch management and compliance", "version": "1.10.4", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/ferventcoder/chocolatey-packages/master/icons/puppet.png", "author": "Puppet", "downloadCount": 36217, "tags": ["puppet", "configuration", "management", "infrastructure", "automation", "facter", "hiera", "mco", "mcollective", "marionette", "collective"]}
