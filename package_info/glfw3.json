{"description": "GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for creating windows with OpenGL contexts and receiving input and events. It is easy to integrate into existing applications and does not lay claim to the main loop.\n\nGLFW is written in C and has native support for Windows, OS X and many Unix-like systems using the X Window System, such as Linux and FreeBSD.\n\nGLFW is licensed under the zlib/libpng license.\n\nThis package installs the library in a 'brew' like fashion. It is installed inside the Chocolatey Install folder under the folders 'msvc110-32', 'msvc120-32', 'msvc110-64', 'msvc120-64', 'include'. The msvc folders include binaries built for Visual Studio. The include folder includes library headers.", "updated": "2024-03-22T21:33:45Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/glfw3/3.0.4.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/glfw3/3.0.4.1", "licenseUrl": "http://www.glfw.org/license.html", "packageName": "glfw3", "displayName": "GLFW 3", "summary": "", "version": "3.0.4.1", "icon": "", "author": "Marcus Geelnard, Camilla Berglund", "downloadCount": 5578, "tags": ["Library", "OpenGL", "Windowing"]}
