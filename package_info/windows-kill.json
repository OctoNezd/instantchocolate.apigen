{"description": "Send signal to process by PID in Windows, like POSIX kill\n      Windows has no process signaling mechanism like what POSIX provide using the kill command. But windows-kill could send signal to process by PID\n      \n      ## Features\n      * Support both 32bit (Win32) and 64bit (x64) Windows\n      * Support both SIGNBREAK (Ctrl + Break) and SIGINT (Ctrl + C) Signals\n      \n      ## Usage Examples\n      Using the **windows-kill** is easy and straightforward. It's just like POSIX kill. If signal sending was successful or any error occurred during the sending, appropriate message will be printed in cmd.\n      \n      ### Sending signal to PID\n      ```\n      windows-kill -SIGNALTYPE PID\n      ```\n\n      ### Sending SIGBREAK (Ctrl + Break) to sample 1234 PID\n      ```\n      windows-kill -SIGBREAK 1234\n      windows-kill -1 1234\n      ```\n\n      ### Sending SIGINT (Ctrl + C) to sample 1234 PID\n      ```\n      windows-kill -SIGINT 1234\n      windows-kill -2 1234\n      ```\n\n      ### List supported signal types\n      ```\n      windows-kill -l\n      ```\n\n      ### Usage help\n      ```\n      windows-kill -h\n      ```", "updated": "2024-03-22T11:03:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/windows-kill/1.1.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/windows-kill/1.1.4", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/alirdn/windows-kill-chocolatey/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "windows-kill", "displayName": "windows-kill (Commandline)", "summary": "Send signal to process by PID in Windows, like POSIX kill.", "version": "1.1.4", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/alirdn/windows-kill-chocolatey/cb8a06eb/resources/icon.png", "author": "alirdn", "downloadCount": 3930, "tags": ["windows", "kill", "signal", "send", "x86", "x64"]}
