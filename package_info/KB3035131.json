{"description": "This security update resolves privately reported vulnerabilities in Windows. The most severe effect of the vulnerabilities is elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to an affected system and runs a specially crafted application. An attacker who has successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the security context of the account of another user who is logged on to the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts that have full user rights. To learn more about the vulnerabilities, see [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS15-025](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms15-025).\n\nThis package requires Service Pack 1 for Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 to be installed first. The [KB976932 package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/KB976932) may be used to install it. On Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008, Service Pack 2 is required.\n\nOn systems later than Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2, this package installs successfully, but does nothing.\n\nThis update is recommended to install before installing KB3033929 on Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/KB3035131/1.0.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/KB3035131/1.0.3", "licenseUrl": "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=206977", "packageName": "KB3035131", "displayName": "Security update for Windows kernel: March 10, 2015", "summary": "This security update resolves privately reported vulnerabilities in Windows.", "version": "1.0.3", "icon": "https://assets.onestore.ms/cdnfiles/onestorerolling-1509-17011/shell/v1_2/images/logo/microsoft.png", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 27159770, "tags": ["microsoft", "windows", "update", "kb3035131", "admin"]}
