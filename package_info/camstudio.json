CamStudio also lets you add screen captions or video annotations to your recordings through anti-aliased images, or by producing a Webcam movie of yourself (screen in screen) on your desktop. And CamStudio comes with its own lossless codec that produces crystal clear results with a much smaller filesize compared some popular codecs, like Microsoft Video 1. Additional options include cursor controls, the ability to record an entire screen or a portion of it, and selections for output quality. Best of all, CamStudio is easy to use and navigate, plus it includes a built-in Help file.", "updated": "2024-03-22T15:18:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/camstudio/2.7.316.20161004", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/camstudio/2.7.316.20161004", "licenseUrl": "https://sourceforge.net/directory/os:windows/license:gpl/", "packageName": "camstudio", "displayName": "CamStudio (Install)", "summary": "Free screen recording software", "version": "2.7.316.20161004", "icon": "https://a.fsdn.com/allura/p/camstudio/icon", "author": "JanHgm,  Nick the Greek,  and others", "downloadCount": 9631, "tags": ["camstudio", "screen", "recorder", "admin"]}
