This is not a registry cleaner or scanner.\n\nThe Windows Registry is a hierarchical database that stores \nconfiguration settings and options on Microsoft Windows operating \nsystems.\n\nJust like databases the registry can become bloated and large when \nthere has been a lot of additions and deletions from the registry. When \nthis happens the system can become slower and use more CPU as \nprograms and the operating system take longer to read and write to the \nregistry, just like any other database.\n\nThis program does NOT remove or add anything to the registry. What it \ndoes is it rebuilds the registry to new files, when this happens all the \noverhead is gone and the registry is smaller and faster.\n\nMicrosoft offers a manual way to do this:\nHow to Compress \"Bloated\" Registry Hives\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/2498915\n\nThanks to this program you can now do it with one click. :-)\n\n**SOCIAL MEDIA:**\n[FACEBOOK](https://www.facebook.com/tweakingdotcom) | [TWITTER](https://twitter.com/tweaking_com)\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/registry-compressor/readme.md)**", "updated": "2024-03-18T10:03:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/registry-compressor/1.1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/registry-compressor/1.1.0", "licenseUrl": "http://www.tweaking.com/core/termsofuse/index.html", "packageName": "registry-compressor", "displayName": "Tweaking.com - Registry Compressor (Install)", "summary": "Tweaking.com - Registry Compressor", "version": "1.1.0", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/registry-compressor/RegistryCompressor_icon.png", "author": "Tweaking.com", "downloadCount": 898, "tags": ["tweaking.com", "registry", "compressor", "notsilent", "admin"]}
