{"description": "**Static Web Server** (or **`SWS`** abbreviated) is a very small and fast production-ready web server suitable to serve static web files or assets.\n\n      It is focused on **lightness and easy-to-use** principles while keeping [high performance and safety](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html) powered by [The Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang.org).\n      \n      Written on top of [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) and [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) runtime. It provides [concurrent and asynchronous networking abilities](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/02_why_async.html) as well as the latest HTTP/1 - HTTP/2 implementations.\n      \n      ##Features\n      \n      - Built with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) which is focused on [safety, speed and concurrency](https://kornel.ski/rust-c-speed).\n      - Memory safe and very reduced CPU and RAM overhead.\n      - Optional GZip, Deflate or Brotli compression for text-based web files only.\n      - Compression on-demand via [Accept-Encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) header.\n      - [Partial Content Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_serving) support for byte-serving of large files.\n      - Optional [Cache-Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) headers for assets.\n      - [Termination signal](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Termination-Signals.html) handling with [graceful shutdown](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubernetes-best-practices-terminating-with-grace) ability and grace period.\n      - [HTTP/2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540) + TLS support.\n      - [Security headers](https://web.dev/security-headers/) for HTTP/2 by default.\n      - [HEAD](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.2) responses.\n      - Lightweight and configurable logging via [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) crate.\n      - Customizable number of worker threads.\n      - Optional directory listing.\n      - [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) support.\n      - Basic HTTP Authentication.\n      - Customizable HTTP Response Headers for specific file requests via glob patterns.\n      - Fallback pages for 404 errors which are useful for Single-page applications.\n      - Run the server as [Windows Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc783643(v=ws.10)).\n      - Configurable using CLI arguments, environment variables or a file.\n      - Default and custom error pages.\n      - First-class [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) support. [Scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) and the latest [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) Docker images available.\n      - Ability to accept a socket listener as a file descriptor for use in sandboxing and on-demand applications (E.g [systemd](http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket-activation.html)).\n      - Cross-platform. Binaries are available for Linux, macOS, Windows & FreeBSD x86_64 / ARM.\n      \n      ##Documentation\n      \n      For more details about the API, usage and examples please have a look at [The Documentation Website](https://sws.joseluisq.net/).\n      \n      ##Releases\n      \n      - [Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/r/joseluisq/static-web-server/)\n      - [Release Binaries](https://github.com/joseluisq/static-web-server/releases)\n      - [Platforms/Architectures Supported](https://sws.joseluisq.net/platforms-architectures/)", "updated": "2024-03-21T20:33:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/static-web-server/2.9.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/static-web-server/2.9.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joseluisq/static-web-server/master/LICENSE-MIT", "packageName": "static-web-server", "displayName": "Static Web Server (sws)", "summary": "A blazing fast and asynchronous web server for static files-serving.", "version": "2.9.0", "icon": "", "author": "Jose Quintana", "downloadCount": 236, "tags": ["static-web-server", "web-server", "http-server", "file-server"]}
