OpenStack provides the required metadata via HTTP or via ConfigDrive and Cloud-Init takes care of configuring the instance on Linux. However, what would happen if you needed to do the same thing, but on Windows guests? Cloudbase-Init is the Windows equivalent of the Cloud-Init project used on most OpenStack Linux images. When deployed as a service on Windows, Cloudbase-Init takes care of all the guest initialization actions: disk volume expansion, user creation, password generation, custom PowerShell, CMD and Bash scripts execution, Heat templates, PowerShell remoting setup and much more. Even though there were limited options for guest initialization until recently, now you can rest assured. Cloudbase-Init is the Windows equivalent of Cloud-Init: an open source project that brings together all the features handled on Linux, to Windows!", "version": "1.1.2.20220216", "icon": "", "author": "Cloudbase Solutions Srl", "downloadCount": 5734, "tags": ["cloudbaseinit"]}
