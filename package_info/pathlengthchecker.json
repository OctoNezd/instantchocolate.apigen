{"description": "Path Length Checker is a stand-alone app that allows you to specify a root directory, and it gives you back a list of all paths (i.e. files and directories) in that root directory and their lengths. It includes features such as pattern matching and min/max length constraints, as well as the ability to specify a string that should replace the root directory in the results brought back, allowing you to quickly see path lengths if you were to move the files/folders to another location.\n\n![Example](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/deadlydog/PathLengthChecker@221aae256865998137f21f05f9cd79c081c19df5/docs/Images/PathLengthChecker.png)", "updated": "2024-03-20T17:48:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pathlengthchecker/1.11.7", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pathlengthchecker/1.11.7", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/deadlydog/PathLengthChecker/blob/master/License.md", "packageName": "pathlengthchecker", "displayName": "Path Length Checker", "summary": "Easily find path lengths", "version": "1.11.7", "icon": "", "author": "Daniel Schroeder", "downloadCount": 2393, "tags": ["pathlengthchecker", "pathlength", "path", "filename", "filepath", "explorer", "windows", "oss", "embedded"]}
