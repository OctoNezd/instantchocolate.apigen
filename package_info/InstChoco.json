In 2017 I turned that old batch file into a program with many additional features. Thus, **InstChoco** was born. I also integrated **InstChoco** with other Chocolatey packages I've created. **InstChoco** is especially useful when used along with [Choco Package List Backup to Local and Cloud](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-package-list-backup). What you see now is the culmination of many long hard hours of work making **InstChoco** the ULTIMATE Chocolatey and Chocolatey packages (re)installer! **InstChoco** is extremely feature rich, but I'm always open to new ideas and features.
