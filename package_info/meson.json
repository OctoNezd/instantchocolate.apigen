{"description": "Meson is an open source build system meant to be both extremely fast, and, even more importantly, as user friendly as possible.\n\nThe main design point of Meson is that every moment a developer spends writing or debugging build definitions is a second wasted. So is every second spent waiting for the build system to actually start compiling code.\n\n**NOTE**: This package is automatically updated. If it is out of date and there is no newer package submitted, please use the `Contact Maintainers` functionality to alert us.", "updated": "2024-03-23T21:48:43Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/meson/1.4.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/meson/1.4.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "meson", "displayName": "Meson", "summary": "Meson is an open source build system.", "version": "1.4.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mikeee/ChocoPackages/icons/meson.png", "author": "Meson development team", "downloadCount": 7731, "tags": ["meson", "build", "dev", "compiling", "compile", "debug"]}
