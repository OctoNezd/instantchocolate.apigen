{"description": "MicrosoftKeyImporter is a KeePass 2.x plugin to provide support for a placeholder `{PICKCUSTOMFIELD}`.\n\nWhen auto-typing a sequence containing this placeholder, a window is displayed that allows to pick a custom string field (whose value is then inserted at the placeholder's position).\n\n#### Purpose\nOn some sites, particularly banking related sites, there are login forms where you have to enter \"The answer for security question 3 out of 5\". In KeePass, you probably have stored these answers in custom fields.\n\nWith the current `{PICKCHARS}` placeholder you can pick single chars out of a field. But for this use case you need a placeholder for a complete field value.\n\n#### Usage\nJust use the new placeholder `{PICKCUSTOMFIELD}` in an Auto-Type sequence. When you execute such a sequence, a window will popup and let you choose a custom field (just like `{PICKCHARS}` does). The value of the picked custom field will be replaced in the Auto-Type sequence.", "updated": "2024-03-12T15:18:53Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/keepass-plugin-autotypecustomfieldpicker/1.0.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/keepass-plugin-autotypecustomfieldpicker/1.0.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/berrnd/KeePassAutoTypeCustomFieldPicker/blob/master/licence.txt", "packageName": "keepass-plugin-autotypecustomfieldpicker", "displayName": "KeePass Plugin AutoTypeCustomFieldPicker", "summary": "KeePass 2 plugin to provide support for a custom placeholder", "version": "1.0.0.0", "icon": "", "author": "Bernd Bestel", "downloadCount": 1297, "tags": ["keepass", "plugin", "customization"]}
