These hooks do micro cleansing by duplicating the features of **Choco Cleaner** before and after package installs, thus RT. No scheduling. No manually running anything. No need to edit a config file. Just install the choco-cleaner-rt-XXX.hook(s) you want. **Choco Cleaner RT** hooks run WHEN you install and update packages.\n\n### NOTES:\n* Recovered disk space will not be as dramatic as when running **Choco-Cleaner** since **Choco-Cleaner-RT** will be running far more often and you'll see smaller results on a per package basis.\n* Some **Choco-Cleaner-RT** micro cleansing happens on previously installed packages instead of the current one due to technical restrictions; i.e. **choco-cleaner-rt-ignores.hook** can not delete .ignore files from the current package or Chocolatey will make shims for everything the packager didn't want shimmed.\n* File deletion logging and toggling the displayed info off are possible via a config, see [choco-cleaner-rt](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt) for more info.\n* A few features of **Choco-Cleaner** are not going to be supported by CCRT such as orphaned shim checking and deleting of Chocolatey .log and .old files; if you want these features please use [Choco-Cleaner](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner).\n\n### Choco Cleaner RT Collection:\n* [choco-cleaner-rt](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt) - installs the most desirable hooks as dependencies and the optional config file\n* [choco-cleaner-rt-archives.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt-archives.hook)\n* [choco-cleaner-rt-chocolateycache.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt-chocolateycache.hook)\n* [choco-cleaner-rt-desktopicons.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt-desktopicons.hook)\n* [choco-cleaner-rt-dotchocolatey.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt-dotchocolatey.hook)\n* [choco-cleaner-rt-ignores.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt-ignores.hook)\n* [choco-cleaner-rt-libbad.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt-libbad.hook)\n* [choco-cleaner-rt-libbkp.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt-libbkp.hook)\n* [choco-cleaner-rt-licenses.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt-licenses.hook)\n* [choco-cleaner-rt-msinstallers.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt-msinstallers.hook)\n* [choco-cleaner-rt-nugetcache.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt-nugetcache.hook)\n* [choco-cleaner-rt-nupkgs.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt-nupkgs.hook)\n* [choco-cleaner-rt-readmes.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt-readmes.hook)\n* [choco-cleaner-rt-startmenuicons.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt-startmenuicons.hook)\n\n**If you find Choco-Cleaner-RT useful, and I suspect you will, please consider donating: https://www.paypal.me/bcurran3donations or become a patron at https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3**", "updated": "2024-03-22T06:33:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt-readmes.hook/0.1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/choco-cleaner-rt-readmes.hook/0.1.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html", "packageName": "choco-cleaner-rt-readmes.hook", "displayName": "(unofficial) Choco Cleaner RT for ReadMe Files (Post-Install Hook)", "summary": "Choco Cleaner RT for ReadMe Files deletes unnecessary files such as readme.md, credits.txt, etc.", "version": "0.1.0", "icon": "https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/choco-cleaner-rt-collection/choco-cleaner-rt_icon.png", "author": "bcurran3", "downloadCount": 96, "tags": ["bcurran3", "unofficial", "choco", "cleaner", "rt", "cleanup", "hook"]}
