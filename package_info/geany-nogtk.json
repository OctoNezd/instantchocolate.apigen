{"description": "Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment (IDE). It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME. So it is using only the GTK2 toolkit and therefore you need only the GTK2 runtime libraries to run Geany.\n\nThis package installs geany with the GTK runtime environment as a required dependency.  The chocolatey package [geany](https://chocolatey.org/packages/geany) includes the GTK environment.\n\n[Screenshots](http://www.geany.org/Documentation/Screenshots)\n[Plugins](http://www.geany.org/Support/Plugins)\n[Manual](http://www.geany.org/Documentation/Manual)\n[Wiki](http://wiki.geany.org/)", "updated": "2024-03-15T10:33:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/geany-nogtk/1.27", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/geany-nogtk/1.27", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/geany/geany/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "geany-nogtk", "displayName": "Geany without GTK", "summary": "Fast and lightweight IDE", "version": "1.27", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/d1e037cc7c943fda29b9067b3b1c3229d99402ff/icons/geany.png", "author": "Enrico Tr\u00f6ger,  Frank Lanitz,  Nick Treleaven and Dominic Hopf", "downloadCount": 2242, "tags": ["text", "editor", "ide", "scintilla"]}
