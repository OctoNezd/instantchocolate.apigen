Please test out a site and the app will tell you if it's included. If not please pass it on and it will be included in the next update.\n\n*  __Converter__: You can convert to mp4, mp3, and GIF\n\n*  __Effects__:\n\t* **Audio Waveform**: Turn clips into .MOV files with transparency for quick edits.\n\t![Example of wave produced](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JCGithu/jackgracie.co.uk/master/dist/wave.jpg)\n\t* **Social Media Blur**: You know that unnamed effect where square or vertical video is centered in a 16:9 frame with a larger, blurred, version behind? Yeah this is that.\n![Social Media Blur example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JCGithu/jackgracie.co.uk/master/dist/blur.jpg)\n\n\n*  __Social Media__: Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, Periscope, Twitch, Weibo, and even Tiktok because I need to stay relevant fellow kids.\n\n*  __TV__:  To download BBC iPlayer and Sounds you will install 'Get_iPlayer'.\n\n*  __Audio__: Sites such as Soundcloud are also covered.\n\n*  __Live Feeds__: Grab livestream codes (.m3u8) from Youtube and Periscope (or Parliament Live if you're missing that excitement in your life) these can be plugged into OBS and other software to record.\n\n*  __Proxies__:\n\t* **Custom Proxies**: Ability to add a custom proxy has been added in settings.\n\t* **Automatic Proxies**: If a custom proxy is not set the app will automatically grab a free service online.
