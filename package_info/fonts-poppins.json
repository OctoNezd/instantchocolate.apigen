{"description": "### About Poppins\n\nGeometric sans serif typefaces have been a popular design tool ever since these actors took to the world\u2019s stage. Poppins is one of the new comers to this long tradition. With support for the Devanagari and Latin writing systems, it is an internationalist take on the genre.\n\nMany of the Latin glyphs (such as the ampersand) are more constructed and rationalist than is typical. The Devanagari design is particularly new, and is the first ever Devanagari typeface with a range of weights in this genre. Just like the Latin, the Devanagari is based on pure geometry, particularly circles.", "updated": "2024-03-23T20:03:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/fonts-poppins/1.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/fonts-poppins/1.1", "licenseUrl": "https://scripts.sil.org/OFL", "packageName": "fonts-poppins", "displayName": "Poppins Fonts", "summary": "Poppins Fonts - Geometric sans serif typefaces have been a popular design tool ever since these actors took to the world\u2019s stage.
