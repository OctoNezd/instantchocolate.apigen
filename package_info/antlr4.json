{"description": "# ANTLR v4\n\n**ANTLR** (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build parse trees and also generates a listener interface (or visitor) that makes it easy to respond to the recognition of phrases of interest.\n\n*Given day-job constraints, my time working on this project is limited so I'll have to focus first on fixing bugs rather than changing/improving the feature set. Likely I'll do it in bursts every few months. Please do not be offended if your bug or pull request does not yield a response! --parrt*\n\n[![Donate](https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/x-click-butcc-donate.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=BF92STRXT8F8Q)", "updated": "2024-03-23T07:33:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/antlr4/4.7.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/antlr4/4.7.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "antlr4", "displayName": "antlr4 (Install)", "summary": "ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files.", "version": "4.7.2", "icon": "https://www.antlr.org/images/antlr-logo.png", "author": "Terence Parr", "downloadCount": 6505, "tags": ["antlr4", "antlr", "parsing", "parser-generator", "grammar", "parse", "language-recognition"]}
