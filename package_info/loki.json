{"description": "Grafana Loki is a set of components that can be composed into a fully featured logging stack.\n\nUnlike other logging systems, Loki is built around the idea of only indexing metadata about your logs: labels (just like Prometheus labels). Log data itself is then compressed and stored in chunks in object stores such as S3 or GCS, or even locally on the filesystem. A small index and highly compressed chunks simplifies the operation and significantly lowers the cost of Loki.", "updated": "2024-03-22T14:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/loki/2.9.5", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/loki/2.9.5", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "loki", "displayName": "Loki", "summary": "Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus", "version": "2.9.5", "icon": "", "author": "Grafana team", "downloadCount": 2837, "tags": ["admin", "server", "logs", "grafana", "foss", "cross-platform"]}
