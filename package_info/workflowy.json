{"description": "WorkFlowy is a simple organizational tool that enables users \n    to create personal to-do lists, take notes, and many more. \n    It is a text-based, zoomable bulleted list that is very flexible in allowing users\n    to organize ideas in any way they want. \n    It is a notebook for lists which can be separated or categorized as lists for goals,\n    projects, to-dos, ideas, links and others. It is completely searchable, and by zooming\n    on a particular list or word, users can drill down to focus on that item alone.", "updated": "2024-03-20T01:03:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/workflowy/1.3.5.17133", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/workflowy/1.3.5.17133", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "workflowy", "displayName": "WorkFlowy", "summary": "Workflowy is a web-based outliner to organize your brain", "version": "1.3.5.17133", "icon": "", "author": "WorkFlowy,  Inc.", "downloadCount": 2149, "tags": ["workflowy", "productivity", "todolist", "organiser"]}
