For example, if more counters are added to the configuration file, the script will notice and start sending metrics for them to Graphite in the next send interval\n* Additional functions are exposed that allow you to send data to Graphite from PowerShell easily\n* Script can be installed to run as a service\n* Installable by Chef Cookbook [which is available here](https://github.com/tas50/chef-graphite_powershell_functions/)\n* Installable by Puppet [which is available here](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/graphite_powershell)\n* Supports Hosted Graphite [which is available here](https://www.hostedgraphite.com)", "updated": "2024-03-22T07:48:45Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/graphite-powershell/1.2.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/graphite-powershell/1.2.2", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "graphite-powershell", "displayName": "Graphite-Powershell", "summary": "Send metrics to Graphite using Powershell", "version": "1.2.2", "icon": "https://rawgit.com/gekeugen/ChocolateyPackages/master/icons/graphite-powershell.png", "author": "\u0421\u041a\u0411 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0443\u0440", "downloadCount": 909, "tags": ["monitoring", "performance", "windows-counters", "graphite", "metrics"]}
