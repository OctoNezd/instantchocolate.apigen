{"description": "Theseus is a new type of JavaScript debugger for Node.js, Chrome, and both simultaneously. It is an extension for the Brackets code editor.\n\n* Real-time code coverage: Theseus shows the number of times that every function has been called next to its definition. Functions that have never been called are also given a gray background. You can watch the code light up as you interact with the web page.\n\n* Retroactive inspection: Click a call count to see the values of parameters, return values, and any exceptions that have been thrown from that function. It's like adding console.log without having to save and reload.\n\n* Asynchronous call tree: If you click multiple call counts, all invocations of those functions are shown in a tree. When callback functions are called, they show up in the tree under the function that created them, regardless of whether they were called immediately or many ticks later.\n\nhttp://brackets.io/", "updated": "2024-03-21T20:03:37Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/Brackets.Theseus/0.2.8", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/Brackets.Theseus/0.2.8", "licenseUrl": "http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT", "packageName": "Brackets.Theseus", "displayName": "Theseus JavaScript debugger for Brackets", "summary": "A pretty darn cool JavaScript debugger for Brackets.", "version": "0.2.8", "icon": "https://github.com/Iristyle/ChocolateyPackages/raw/master/Brackets/brackets_logo.png", "author": "Adobe", "downloadCount": 2018, "tags": ["editor", "web", "adobe", "javascript", "html", "css", "debugger", "nodejs"]}
