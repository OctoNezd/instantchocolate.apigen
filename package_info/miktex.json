{"description": "MiKTeX (pronounced mick-tech) is an up-to-date implementation of TeX/LaTeX and related programs. [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) is a typesetting system written by [Donald Ervin Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) who says that it is intended for the creation of beautiful books - and especially for books that contain a lot of mathematics. \n\nMiKTeX comes with TeXworks, a TeX frontend which you can use it to edit and preview LaTeX documents. \n\n![FancyLaTeXOutput](https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/fancy-latex-output.png)\nThe sky is the limit when it comes to TeX/LaTeX, with drawings, chemical equations, syntax trees, circuit diagrams, mathematical expressions, proof systems, chessboards and more! ([Image source](https://mathvault.ca/latex-guide))\n\nMiKTeX's integrated package manager installs missing [components](https://miktex.org/packages) from the Internet, if required. \n\n## Package Set Parameter (optional)\n\n* `/Set:(option)` - Download and install the `essential`, `basic` (default), or `complete` set of TeX packages/tools.\n* `/Mirror:(URL)` - This will use the `(url)`, [a CTAN mirror](https://miktex.org/repositories) to download MiKTeX.  It is recommended to only use this if the default mirror as chosen by the MiKTeX setup utility doesn't work for some reason.* **Hint:** Including `/Mirror` (valid or not) will write the list of \"official\", URLs to the Chocolatey log.\n* `/ThisUser` - This will install MiKTeX for only this user.  **Note: This can cause confusion for other users as Chocolatey will claim MiKTeX is installed but other users will (potentially) not be able to see/use it.\n\n## Custom Repository Parameter (optional)\n\nThis package has only the MiKTeX setup utility embedded.  Any new install of MiKTeX involves using the setup utility to download and create a (temporary by default) repository and then installing from that repository.  This Chocolatey package can both establish a more permenant repository (for sharing with other computers) and use a specific (possibly private) repository from which to install MiKTeX.  Thus a single computer within a network could download MiKTeX from the internet and create a repository, and all other computers on the network could use that repository to install MiKTeX saving external bandwidth.\n\n#### Using a Custom Repository:\n* `/RepoPath:(path)` -- with a local or UNC path.  This will install or update MiKTeX from a specific existing repository.  No attempt to update the repository itself will be made.  Upgrades **should** use this repository in the future by default.  **Note:** If both `/RepoPath` (with a UNC path) and `/Mirror` are used, `/Mirror` will be ignored.\n\n#### Creating a Custom Repository:\n* `/RepoPath:(path)` - with a local directory as `(path)`.  This will create (or update) the repository in the location.  MiKTeX will also be installed.  **Note:** The repository will not be shared or accessible to other systems without additional administrator actions and will not be removed on an uninstall.\n\n#### Examples:\n\n* On a server, you might use:\n\n`choco install miktex.install --params '\"/Set:complete /RepoPath:\"\"c:\\Shared Files\\MiKTeX-Repo\"\"\"'`\n*Double-double quotes (i.e. `\"\"path\"\"`) are necessary for paths containing a space.*\n\n* On a workstation in the same network, you might use:\n\n`choco install miktex.install --params '\"/RepoPath:\\\\localserver\\MiKTeX-Repo\"'`", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:03:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/miktex/24.3.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/miktex/24.3.0", "licenseUrl": "http://miktex.org/copying", "packageName": "miktex", "displayName": "MiKTeX", "summary": "An implementation of TeX/LaTeX", "version": "24.3.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages@c9dd968b548035ac3a749235c638f9a895df54b8/Icons/miktex_icon.png", "author": "Christian Schenk", "downloadCount": 313486, "tags": ["miktex", "tex", "latex", "pdf", "typesetting", "foss", "embedded"]}
