{"description": "PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly.\n\nThis product includes PHP software, freely available from [http://www.php.net/software/](http://www.php.net/software/)\n\n## Package Parameters\n- `/DontAddToPath` - Do not add install directory to path\n- `/InstallDir`    - Override the installation directory (needs to be specified both during install and update, until it is remembered by choco)\n- `/ThreadSafe`    - Install the thread safe version of php that is compatible with Apache.\n\nThese parameters can be passed to the installer with the use of --package-parameters.\nFor example: `choco install php --package-parameters='\"/ThreadSafe \"\"/InstallDir:C:\\PHP\"\"\"'`.\n\n## Notes\n\n- **If the package is out of date please check [Version History](#versionhistory) for the latest submitted version.
