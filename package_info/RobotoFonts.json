{"description": "Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn\ufffdt compromise, allowing letters to be settle in to their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.", "updated": "2024-03-22T16:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/RobotoFonts/4.0.0.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/RobotoFonts/4.0.0.1", "licenseUrl": "http://www.fontsquirrel.com/license/roboto", "packageName": "RobotoFonts", "displayName": "", "summary": "", "version": "4.0.0.1", "icon": "", "author": "Christian Robertson", "downloadCount": 12271, "tags": ["font", "monospace", "droid"]}
