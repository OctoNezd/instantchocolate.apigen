View computers that have the same installed applications, hardware, operating systems, and even Windows updates. Additionally, create groups based on your own criteria.\n\n### Utilities\nEasily launch remote desktop, remote command, reboot/shutdown, WOL, event viewer, and more. Incorporate and run your own scripts and favorite utilities with ease.\n\n### Reports\nReport on the exact data you need by using the built-in reports or create your own. Reports are created using our filters or even SQL. Run reports on any or all computers in the database then print, export and even save and email on a regular schedule to all your bosses.\n\n### Integration with PDQ Deploy\nEasily identify which computers are out-of-date and use PDQ Deploy to deploy to those particular PCs. Automatically update PDQ Inventory directly following the deployment. However, best of all is automatically deploying when a computer goes from offline to online in PDQ Inventory.\n\n### Insanely Detailed Data Tracking\nThe Collection Library makes it easy to see which computers have out-of-date popular applications or run times. These groupings are updated as new versions of these apps, updates, and runtimes are released and serve as great templates for creating your own.\n\n### Find What You Want, When You Want\nPDQ Inventory offers customization in what data is gathered and when. Make sure the information most important to you is at hand at the time it's needed. Easily scan for:\n\n- Active Directory\n- Applications\n- Computer Details\n- Disks\n- Displays\n- Environment Variables\n- Files\n- Hardware Devices\n- Hot Fixes\n- Memory Modules\n- Network Adapters\n- Printers\n- Registry\n- Services\n- Shares\n- Users and Groups\n- Windows Features\n\n### Multi-Admin Access With a Shared Database\nShare your reports and collections with other admins by creating a server/client relationship. Maybe they'll buy you a drink for all of the work you saved them.\n\n**Memory Requirements:** 4 GB RAM, 8 GB recommended\n\n**OS Requirements:** Windows 10, 11, 8x, Server 2012x or higher\n\n**SOCIAL MEDIA:**\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdmArsenal) | [YouTube](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pdq.com) | [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pdq.com) | [spiceworks](https://community.spiceworks.com/pages/pdq)\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/asheroto/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/pdq-inventory/README.md)**", "updated": "2024-03-23T08:18:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pdq-inventory/19.3.537", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pdq-inventory/19.3.537", "licenseUrl": "https://www.pdq.com/end-user-license-agreement/", "packageName": "pdq-inventory", "displayName": "PDQ Inventory (Install)", "summary": "PDQ Inventory is a systems management tool that scans Windows computers to collect hardware, software, and Windows configuration data.", "version": "19.3.537", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/asheroto/ChocolateyPackages/1a99fbb8/pdq-inventory/icon.png", "author": "PDQ", "downloadCount": 4423, "tags": ["arsenal", "pdq", "inventory", "tool", "software", "hardware", "scanning", "trial"]}
