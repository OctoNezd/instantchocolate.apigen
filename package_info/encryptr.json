{"description": "Encryptr is simple and easy to use. It stores your sensitive data like passwords, credit card data, PINs, or access codes, in the cloud. However, because it was built on the zero-knowledge Crypton framework, Encryptr ensures that only the user has the ability to access or read the confidential information. Not the app's developers, cloud storage provider, or any third party.\n\nEncryptr only ever encrypts or decrypts your data locally on your device. No plain text is ever sent to the server, not even your passphrase. This is what zero-knowledge means.\n\n[Wiki](https://github.com/devgeeks/Encryptr/wiki)", "updated": "2024-03-18T22:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/encryptr/1.2.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/encryptr/1.2.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/devgeeks/Encryptr/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "encryptr", "displayName": "Encryptr", "summary": "Zero-knowledge, cloud-based e-wallet / password manager powered by Crypton", "version": "1.2.0", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/57cd6e1f3d2367f2f348bdf73473713cc8a4a4e2/icons/encryptr.svg", "author": "Devgeeks", "downloadCount": 1535, "tags": ["security", "encryption", "password", "manager", "cloud", "zero-knowledge"]}
