{"description": "A few years ago, I found myself writing my first PHP projects using metapad. When I was looking around for text editors with syntax highlighting, I have come across the Scintilla source code editing component. I was very much impressed by this project, so I decided to create my own Scintilla-based text editor.\n\nThe result is Notepad2, a fast and light-weight Notepad-like text editor with syntax highlighting. This program can be run out of the box without installation, and does not touch your system's registry.", "updated": "2024-03-23T17:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/notepad2/4.2.25.20160422", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/notepad2/4.2.25.20160422", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "notepad2", "displayName": "Notepad2", "summary": "A fast and light-weight Notepad-like text editor with syntax highlighting.", "version": "4.2.25.20160422", "icon": "http://anthonymastrean.github.io/chocolateypackages/icons/notepad2.png", "author": "Florian Balmer", "downloadCount": 63150, "tags": ["notepad"]}
