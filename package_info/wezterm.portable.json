There are a couple of channels for support:\n\n* You can use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues) to see if someone else has a similar issue, or to file a new one.\n* Start or join a thread in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/discussions); if you have general\n  questions or want to chat with other wezterm users, you're welcome here!\n* There is a [Matrix room via Element.io](https://app.element.io/#/room/#wezterm:matrix.org)\n  for (potentially!) real time discussions.\n\nThe GitHub Discussions and Element/Gitter rooms are better suited for questions\nthan bug reports, but don't be afraid to use whichever you are most comfortable\nusing and we'll work it out.", "updated": "2024-03-21T08:03:40Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/wezterm.portable/20240203.110809.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/wezterm.portable/20240203.110809.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/wez/wezterm/blob/main/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "wezterm.portable", "displayName": "Wez's Terminal (Portable)", "summary": "A GPU-accelerated cross-platform terminal emulator and multiplexer written by @wez and implemented in Rust", "version": "20240203.110809.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/corbob/ChocoPackages@master/icons/wezterm.png", "author": "Wez Furlong", "downloadCount": 789, "tags": ["wezterm", "wez", "terminal", "emulator"]}
