{"description": "GeoDa is a free and open source software tool that serves as an introduction to spatial data analysis. It is designed to facilitate new insights from data analysis by exploring and modeling spatial patterns.\n\nGeoDa was developed by [Dr. Luc Anselin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luc_Anselin) and his [team](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/directories/full/team). The program provides a user-friendly and graphical interface to methods of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), such as spatial autocorrelation statistics for aggregate data (several thousand records), and basic spatial regression analysis for point and polygon data (tens of thousands of records). To work with big data in GeoDa it should first be aggregated to areal units.\n\n### GeoDa Abilities\n* [Work with a large variety of vector data in different formats.](https://geodacenter.github.io/formats.html) \n* Convert coordinates in table format (.csv, .dbf, .xls, .ods) to spatial data formats.\n* Multi-layer support!\n* Explore Statistical Results through Linked Maps and Charts.\n* Analyze Spatial and Temporal Patterns Across Linked Views.\n* Ground-Truth Map Results with Basemaps.\n* Compare Averages Across Time and Space.\n* Detect Relationships in Multivariate Space.\n* Find Statistically Significant Spatial Clusters.\n* Compare a Suite of Spatially Constrained Cluster Techniques.\n* Determine if Changes Over Time Are Spatially Clustered.\n* Test if Multiple Variables Are Clustered in Space.\n* Map Patterns of Non-Spatial Cluster Statistics\n* Find the Threshold Where Spatial Correlation Ends.\n* Explore the Impact of Flexible Data Categorization.", "updated": "2024-03-22T12:33:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/geoda/1.22.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/geoda/1.22.0", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html", "packageName": "geoda", "displayName": "GeoDa", "summary": "An introduction to spatial data analysis.", "version": "1.22.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages@85290e2431b5ea98a18c220f29643db751d80412/Icons/geoda_icon.png", "author": "Center for Spatial Data Science (CSDS)", "downloadCount": 11059, "tags": ["geoda", "esda", "spatial", "statistics", "maps", "gis", "admin", "embedded"]}
