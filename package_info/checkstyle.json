{"description": "Checkstyle is a development tool to help programmers write Java code that adheres to a coding standard. It automates the process of checking Java code to spare humans of this boring (but important) task. This makes it ideal for projects that want to enforce a coding standard.\n\nCheckstyle is highly configurable and can be made to support almost any coding standard. An example configuration files are supplied supporting the Sun Code Conventions, Google Java Style.\n\n----\n\nDue to changes in the Java 8 package, you may have to set your own `%JAVA_HOME%` environment variable. Checkstyle is a JAR and, as you can see in the included `checkstyle.bat` file, we have to run the checkstyle JAR through the `java` command.", "updated": "2024-03-11T04:33:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/checkstyle/6.18", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/checkstyle/6.18", "licenseUrl": "http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/license.html", "packageName": "checkstyle", "displayName": "Checkstyle", "summary": "Checkstyle is a development tool to help programmers write Java code that adheres to a coding standard.", "version": "6.18", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnthonyMastrean/chocolateypackages/2257c158a8b2b0dd9fea7602ee7b85c85a2ca88c/public/icons/checkstyle.png", "author": "checkstyle", "downloadCount": 1704, "tags": ["java", "source", "code", "style"]}
