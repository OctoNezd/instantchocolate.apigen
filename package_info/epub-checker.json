{"description": "# pagina EPUB-Checker\n\nWith pagina EPUB Checker you can put your EPUB files through their paces before you send them out for delivery. Just drag and drop the EPUB file(s) onto the checker\u2019s main window and it starts working. Error messages and hints are displayed in clear language and easy to understand.\n\nBy the way: You can choose the language.\n\nAnd: EPUB Checker does not need to be installed, so it also works portably on a USB stick or a computer without administrator rights.\n\nThe test mechanisms of the EPUB Checker are based\u00a0on the official open source EPUBCheck tools (version 4.2.6). pagina EPUB Checker encapsulates this tool and offers you additional features:\n\n    Graphical user interface\n    Drag & drop\n    Validation of unzipped EPUB files\n    These are automatically converted into an EPUB before validation and if they are valid they are also saved as an EPUB file\n    Multilingualism (see table)\n    \n## Package Parameters\n\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n- `/NOICON` - Do not install a Desktop Icon\n\nTo pass parameters, use `--params \"''\"` (e.g. `choco install packageID [other options] --params=\"'/ITEM:value /ITEM2:value2 /FLAG_BOOLEAN'\"`).\nTo have choco remember parameters on upgrade, be sure to set `choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`.\n\n## Maintainer's Note\n\nI produce and maintain Chocolatey packages in my spare time, for free. If you use my packages, and appreciate the time and effort I put into making and maintaining them, please consider [making a small donation](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jtcmedia).
