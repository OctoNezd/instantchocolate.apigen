{"description": "Wtrace [spelled: w\u026atre\u026as] is a command-line tool for recording trace events from the Operating System or a group of processes. Wtrace may collect, among others, File I/O operations, Registry operations, and TPC/IP connections. Its purpose is to give you some insights into what is happening in the system.\n\nAdditionally, it has various filtering capabilities and may also dump statistics at the end of the trace session. As it's just a standard command-line tool, you may pipe its output to another tool for further processing.\n\nIt works on Windows 8.1+ and requires .NET 4.7.2+. Wtrace is just one executable, wtrace.exe, and you may download it from the release page.\n\nSome antivirus report wtrace as malware. If the binary checksum matches the one in the choco package, it is a false-positive. You may find more information in the repository README (https://github.com/lowleveldesign/wtrace#readme) or the documentation.", "updated": "2024-03-17T21:48:46Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/wtrace/3.4.2416.12", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/wtrace/3.4.2416.12", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "wtrace", "displayName": "wtrace", "summary": "Command line tracing tool for Windows, based on ETW.", "version": "3.4.2416.12", "icon": "https://wtrace.net/wtrace-icon.png", "author": "Sebastian Solnica", "downloadCount": 395, "tags": ["wtrace", "windows", "tracing"]}
