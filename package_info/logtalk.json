{"description": "Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.\n\nImplemented as a trans-compiler in highly portable, extensively tested, and well documented code, it can use most modern and standards compliant Prolog implementations as a backend compiler.\n\nAs a multi-paradigm language, it includes support for modules, prototypes, classes, protocols (interfaces), categories (components and hot patching), event-driven programming, and high-level multi-threading programming. Distributed under a commercial friendly license, it includes full documentation, portable libraries, portable developer tools, and a large number of programming examples to help get you started.\n\n## Package Parameters\n\n- `/DIR` - Installation directory (default is \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Logtalk\")\n\nExample: `choco install logtalk --params \"'/DIR=%ChocolateyInstall%\\lib\\'\"`\n\n## Notes\n\n- The backend Prolog compilers you intend to use must be installed before installing Logtalk.", "updated": "2024-03-23T03:33:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/logtalk/3.76.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/logtalk/3.76.0", "licenseUrl": "https://logtalk.org/license.html", "packageName": "logtalk", "displayName": "Logtalk", "summary": "Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.", "version": "3.76.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/LogtalkDotOrg/chocolatey-packages@master/icons/logtalk.png", "author": "Paulo Moura", "downloadCount": 3712, "tags": ["logtalk", "logic-programming", "prolog", "oop", "declarative-language", "declarative-programming"]}
