If you do not specifiy a file extension the original file extension will be preserved.\n      \n      *Note: if you include periods in your new file name, you should include a file extension to prevent whatever is after the last period from becoming the new extension. I recommend using `.` to preserve the original file etension.*", "updated": "2024-03-23T12:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rename-cli/7.0.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/rename-cli/7.0.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/jhotmann/node-rename-cli/blob/master/license", "packageName": "rename-cli", "displayName": "rename-cli", "summary": "A command line utility for renaming files", "version": "7.0.2", "icon": "", "author": "Jordan Hotmann", "downloadCount": 627, "tags": ["rename", "cli", "batch", "utility", "replacement", "regex", "nunjucks"]}
