{"description": "Zim is a graphical text editor used to maintain a collection of wiki pages. Each page can contain links to other pages, simple formatting and images. Pages are stored in a folder structure, like in an outliner, and can have attachments. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a nonexistent page. All data is stored in plain text files with wiki formatting. Various plugins provide additional functionality, like a task list manager, an equation editor, a tray icon, and support for version control.", "updated": "2024-03-23T13:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/zim/0.68", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/zim/0.68", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html", "packageName": "zim", "displayName": "Zim Desktop Wiki", "summary": "A WYSIWYG text editor that aims at bringing the concept of a wiki to the desktop.", "version": "0.68", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/knochenhans/chocolatey/master/zim.png", "author": "Jaap G.
