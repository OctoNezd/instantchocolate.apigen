{"description": "ELinks is a program for browsing the web in text mode. The goal of the project has from the beginning been to provide a feature-rich text mode browser with an open patches/features inclusion policy and active development. One of these features is that ELinks includes Links-Lua which adds scripting capabilities to ELinks. ELinks was forked from the original Links browser written by Mikulas Patocka. It is in no way associated with Twibright Labs and their Links version. Please read to the history page for more information about the various Links versions and forks. Over the years many people have contributed to making ELinks what it is today.", "updated": "2024-03-23T12:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/elinks/0.12.3.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/elinks/0.12.3.2", "licenseUrl": "http://elinks.or.cz/COPYING", "packageName": "elinks", "displayName": "ELinks - Full-Featured Text WWW Browser", "summary": "ELinks is an advanced and well-established feature-rich text mode web (HTTP/FTP/..) browser.
