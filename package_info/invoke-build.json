{"description": "Invoke-Build is a build and test automation tool which invokes tasks defined in PowerShell v2.0+ scripts. It is similar to psake but arguably easier to use and more powerful. It is complete, bug free, well covered by tests.\n\n## Features\n\n- Incremental tasks with effectively processed inputs and outputs.\n- Persistent builds which can be resumed after interruptions.\n- Parallel builds in separate workspaces with common stats.\n- Batch invocation of tests composed as tasks.\n- Ability to define new classes of tasks.\n\nInvoke-Build can invoke the current task from a build script being composed in ISE and VSCode, see *Invoke-TaskFromISE.ps1* and *Invoke-TaskFromVSCode.ps1*.\n\nInvoke-Build can be used as the task runner in VSCode with tasks maintained in a PowerShell build script instead of *tasks.json*, see *New-VSCodeTask.ps1*.\n\nInvoke-Build v3.0.1 is cross-platform with PowerShell v6.0.0-alpha.\n\n## Notes\n\n- This package includes `Invoke-TaskFromISE`, `Invoke-TaskFromVSCode`, `New-VSCodeTask` and `Invoke-Build.ArgumentCompleters` supportive scripts. To setup launch profile in VSCode for build.ps1 files, use the following script path in `launch.json`:\n   ```json\n   \"script\": \"${env:ChocolateyInstall}/lib/invoke-build/tools/Invoke-TaskFromVSCode.ps1\"\n   ```\n- Its recommended to include the following in your PowerShell `$PROFILE`:\n    ```powershell\n    sal ib Invoke-Build\n    & $env:ChocolateyInstall\\lib\\invoke-build\\tools\\Invoke-Build.ArgumentCompleters.ps1\n    ```", "updated": "2024-03-23T16:33:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/invoke-build/5.11.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/invoke-build/5.11.0", "licenseUrl": "http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0", "packageName": "invoke-build", "displayName": "Invoke-Build", "summary": "Invoke-Build is a build and test automation tool", "version": "5.11.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/majkinetor/chocolatey/invoke-build/icon.png", "author": "Roman Kuzmin", "downloadCount": 32538, "tags": ["build", "powershell", "module", "cross-platform", "foss"]}
