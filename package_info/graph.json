{"description": "Graph is an open source application used to draw mathematical graphs in a coordinate system. Anyone who wants to draw graphs of functions will find this program useful. Graph makes it very easy to visualize a function and paste it into another program. It is capable of drawing standard functions, parametric functions, polar functions, tangents, point series, shadings and relations. It is also possible to evaluate a function for a given point, trace a graph with the mouse, do some mathematical calculations on the functions and much more.", "updated": "2024-03-23T21:48:43Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/graph/4.4.2.20170413", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/graph/4.4.2.20170413", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "packageName": "graph", "displayName": "Graph", "summary": "Plotting of mathematical functions", "version": "4.4.2.20170413", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages/master/Icons/graph_icon.png", "author": "Ivan Johansen", "downloadCount": 2094, "tags": ["graph", "plotting", "math", "functions", "admin"]}
