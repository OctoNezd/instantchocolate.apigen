{"description": "---\n\n### [choco://choco-upgrade-all-at-startup](choco://choco-upgrade-all-at-startup)\nTo use choco:// protocol URLs, install [(unofficial) choco:// Protocol support ](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-protocol-support)\n\n---\n\n# DO YOU WANT TO UPGRADE YOUR CHOCOLATEY PACKAGES EVERY TIME YOUR COMPUTER BOOTS? \n\n# YOU JUST FOUND THE EASY WAY!\n\t\n### This package creates a Windows Scheduled Task to run \"choco upgrade all -y\" with enhanced options every time your computer boots.\n\nPlease understand your computer boot time will increase. If you reboot daily, you'll probably never notice. If you reboot infrequently, you'll notice a slow down as packages are downloaded and updated/installed, especially if you have a slow Internet connection. Because of this **choco-upgrade-all-at-startup** is pseudo-deprecated and pseudo-superseded by **[choco upgrade all at](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at)** which allows you to set a time to run \"choco upgrade all -y\" every day in the wee hours of morning while you're happily dreaming of owning a supercomputer instead of twiddling your thumbs waiting for your \"slow\" computer to boot up. Otherwise it works wonderfully at keeping your Chocolatey installed programs up to date.\n\n### USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n* You can do nothing and it will run at startup when on AC power.\n* You can manually run **choco-upgrade-all** from Command Prompt or PowerShell.\n* You can manually click the Upgrade All Packages icon in the Chocolatey Start Menu group if you have [choco-shortcuts-winconfig](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-shortcuts-winconfig) installed.\n* You can manually run **choco-install packagename** from Command Prompt or PowerShell to install packages with your **choco-upgrade-all-at-startup** settings.\n\n### CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS:\nRun **choco-upgrade-all -EditConfig** to enable enhanced options such as:\n* automatically delete newly installed Desktop and Start Menu icons\n* run pre and/or post processing scripts\n* setting a default user profile\n\nSYSADMINS: I recommend use of **choco-upgrade-all-at-startup** for notebook/laptop users who tend to shut down their computers at night and thus miss scheduled updates/maintenance such as **[choco upgrade all at](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at)** (in the wee hours of the morning).\n\n#### IF UPGRADING FROM A VERSION EARLIER THAN 2021.03.15:\nIt is **HIGHLY** advised you read the Release Notes/ChangeLog and **run choco-upgrade-all -EditConfig** to enable the new enhanced features.\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/choco-upgrade-all-at-startup/readme.md)**\n\n**If you find choco-upgrade-all-at-startup useful, and I suspect you will, please consider donating: https://www.paypal.me/bcurran3donations or become a patron at https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3**", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at-startup/2023.5.26", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/choco-upgrade-all-at-startup/2023.5.26", "licenseUrl": "https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Public_domain", "packageName": "choco-upgrade-all-at-startup", "displayName": "(unofficial) Choco Upgrade All at Startup (Task)", "summary": "choco-upgrade-all-at-startup - Configures a scheduled task to run \"choco upgrade all -y\" at Windows startup.", "version": "2023.5.26", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/mylogos/myunofficialChocolateylogo_icon.png", "author": "Bill Curran", "downloadCount": 387205, "tags": ["bcurran3", "unofficial", "choco", "upgrade", "startup", "config", "schtasks", "scheduled", "task"]}
