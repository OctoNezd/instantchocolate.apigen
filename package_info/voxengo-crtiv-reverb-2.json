{"description": "Deprecation note: Package has been deprecated to reflect Voxengo's rebranding from `CRTIV Reverb 2` to `Sobor`. \n\nCRTIV Reverb is a stereo reverberation effect AAX, AudioUnit and VST plugin for professional music production applications.  This reverb plug-in provides a wide palette of reverb spaces while requiring only a minimal effort to obtain useful results.  The tails created by this reverb are very dense and produce a well-defined spatialization.  Since the reverb uses a kind of \u201ctrue stereo\u201d algorithm the panned sounds receive a good stereo field placement.  We believe CRTIV Reverb provides one of the lushest reverb tails available on the market.\n\nThe early reflections placement, pre-delay and levels are chosen automatically based on a pre-defined model that depends on the \u201cRoom Size\u201d and \u201cAmbience\u201d parameters.  CRTIV Reverb is technically based on Feedback Delay Network building blocks using the Hadamard matrix, and uses self-modulation techniques.\n\nCRTIV Reverb is great on any sound sources: vocals, synths, drums, mixes.  The only drawback is that this reverb is a relatively CPU-demanding effect (it takes 7.5% of a single core of i7-7700K processor, at 44100 sample rate), for comfortable use it requires a higher-end processor.\n\n\n## Package Specific\n\n### Package Parameters\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n * `/NoVst2x86`       - Do not install the x86 VST2 version\n * `/NoVst2x64`       - Do not install the x64 VST2 version\n * `/NoVst3x86`       - Do not install the x86 VST3 version\n * `/NoVst3x64`       - Do not install the x64 VST3 version\n * `/NoAaxx86`        - Do not install the x86 AAX version\n * `/NoAaxx64`        - Do not install the x64 AAX version\n * `/NoShortcuts`     - Do not install shortcuts to manuals and uninstaller into start menu or onto desktop\n * `/Vst2Path:`       - Installation path of the VST2 version\n * `/Vst2x86Path:` - Installation path of the x86 VST2 version on x64 CPU architecture\n * `/InstallerPath:`  - Do not download the installer from the official Voxengo website and use the one passed with this argument instead.
