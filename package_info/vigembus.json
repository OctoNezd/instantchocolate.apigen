{"description": "## ViGEm Bus Driver\n\nThe `ViGEmBus` driver and `ViGEmClient` libraries represent the core of the Virtual Gamepad Emulation Framework (or `ViGEm` , for short). `ViGEm` aims for a 100% accurate [emulation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator>) of well-known gaming peripherals as pure software-based devices at kernel level. As it mimics \"the real thing\" games and other processes require no additional modification whatsoever to detect `ViGEm`-based devices (no Proxy-DLLs or API-Hooking) and simply work out of the box. While the (now obsolete) [Scarlett.Crush Productions Virtual Bus Driver](<https://github.com/nefarius/ScpVBus>) is the spiritual father of this project, `ViGEm` has been designed and written from the ground up utilizing Microsoft's [Kernel-Mode Driver Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-Mode_Driver_Framework).\n\n#### Emulated devices\n\nCurrently supports emulation of the following USB Gamepads:\n\n- [Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_controller)\n- [Sony DualShock 4 Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DualShock#DualShock_4)\n\n### Supported Systems\n\nThe driver is built for Windows 10/11, Server 2016, and Server 2019 only (x86 and amd64).\n\n### Package-specific issue\nIf this package isn't up-to-date for some days, [Create an issue](https://github.com/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages/issues/new/choose)\n\nSupport the package maintainer and [![Patreon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@d15c4e19c709e7148588d4523ffc6dd3cd3c7e5e/icons/patreon.png)](https://www.patreon.com/tunisiano)", "updated": "2024-03-23T23:33:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vigembus/1.22.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vigembus/1.22.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "vigembus", "displayName": "Virtual Gamepad Emulation Framework (Install)", "summary": "Windows kernel-mode driver emulating well-known USB game controllers.", "version": "1.22.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@7cc8d197a0daa3297060d92a75902352d1cce156/icons/vigembus.png", "author": "Benjamin H\u00f6glinger-Stelzer", "downloadCount": 2871, "tags": ["vigembus", "virtual", "gamepad", "emulation", "framework", "xbox", "dualshock", "controller", "admin", "foss"]}
