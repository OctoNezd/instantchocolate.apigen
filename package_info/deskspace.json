You can eliminate desktop clutter by arranging your windows and icons across up to six desktops, all easily reachable by navigating a desktop cube.\n\nDeskSpace gives you separate desktops for each of your day-to-day tasks, and lets you quickly and easily switch between desktops and the applications on them.\n\nDeskSpace lets you have different desktop wallpapers and icons on each desktop. You can also choose a name and picture for each desktop, to make them easier to recognize.\n\nDeskSpace runs on low-end netbooks, high-end desktops, and everything in-between.
