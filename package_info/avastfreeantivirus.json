Until the next version is released, please use the `--ignore-checksums` switch with Chocolatey CLI.\n- This package can take upwards of 10 minutes to complete the install (depending on your computer specs, internet bandwidth etc.).\n- The uninstall for this package **is not silent**.\n- This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/avastfreeantivirus/24.2.8918", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/avastfreeantivirus/24.2.8918", "licenseUrl": "https://www.avast.com/eula-avast-consumer-products", "packageName": "avastfreeantivirus", "displayName": "Avast Free Antivirus (Install)", "summary": "Avast Free Antivirus", "version": "24.2.8918", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pauby/ChocoPackages@6cf2f9f5/icons/avastfreeantivirus.png", "author": "Avast Software", "downloadCount": 278002, "tags": ["avast", "free", "antivirus", "security", "av", "admin"]}
