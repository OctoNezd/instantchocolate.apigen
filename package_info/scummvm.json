{"description": "ScummVM is a program which allows you to run a wide variety of classic adventure and role-playing games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the game, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed!\n\nCurrently, ScummVM supports a huge library of adventures with over 250 games in total. It supports many classics published by legendary studios like LucasArts, Sierra On-Line, Revolution Software, Cyan, Inc. and Westwood Studios. Next to ground-breaking titles like the Monkey Island series, Broken Sword, Myst, Blade Runner and countless other games you will find some really obscure adventures and truly hidden gems to explore.", "updated": "2024-03-23T17:33:37Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/scummvm/2.8.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/scummvm/2.8.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html", "packageName": "scummvm", "displayName": "ScummVM", "summary": "Engine for classic adventure and role-playing games.", "version": "2.8.0", "icon": "https://www.scummvm.org/images/scummvm.png", "author": "ScummVM Team", "downloadCount": 5883, "tags": ["games", "gaming", "emulator", "lucasarts", "sierra", "adventure", "rpg", "scumm"]}
