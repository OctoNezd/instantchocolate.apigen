{"description": "Power Dimmer is a Windows screen saver application that, once activated, will gradually dim your screen, fading it from full brightness to a final brightness level that you set. While the screen is dimmed, you can still see all of your windows, as well as any on-screen activity. Move the mouse or press a key and your screen will be restored to full brightness. To install this screen saver, download and unzip the file to your Windows folder and then select WhitSoft Power Dimmer from the list of screen savers in your Display Options control panel.", "updated": "2024-03-22T19:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/powerdimmer/1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/powerdimmer/1.0", "licenseUrl": "http://www.whitsoftdev.com/help/about.php", "packageName": "powerdimmer", "displayName": "Power Dimmer Screensaver", "summary": "Gradually dim your screen on inactivity.", "version": "1.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages@a49cdf4ba756e0dc4a470ba35af40f59d3fe773d/Icons/powerdimmer_icon.png", "author": "Matt Whitlock", "downloadCount": 650, "tags": ["powerdimmer", "dimmer", "screensaver", "darken", "embedded"]}
