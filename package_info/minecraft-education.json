{"description": "## Minecraft education\nMinecraft is a game about breaking and placing blocks. At first, people built structures to protect against nocturnal\nmonsters, but as the game grew players worked together to create wonderful, imaginative things.\n\nIt can also be about adventuring with friends or watching the sun rise over a blocky ocean. It\u2019s pretty. Brave \nplayers battle terrible things in The Nether, which is more scary than pretty. You can also visit a land of mushrooms \nif it sounds more like your cup of tea.\n\n### Package-specific issue\nIf this package isn't up-to-date for some days, [Create an issue](https://github.com/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages/issues/new/choose)\n\nSupport the package maintainer and [![Patreon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@d15c4e19c709e7148588d4523ffc6dd3cd3c7e5e/icons/patreon.png)](https://www.patreon.com/tunisiano)", "updated": "2024-03-23T21:18:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/minecraft-education/1.20.1200", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/minecraft-education/1.20.1200", "licenseUrl": "https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement", "packageName": "minecraft-education", "displayName": "Minecraft Education", "summary": "Minecraft", "version": "1.20.1200", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@7cc8d197a0daa3297060d92a75902352d1cce156/icons/minecraft.png", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 45898, "tags": ["minecraft", "mine", "craft", "microsoft", "education"]}
