You can then analyze the disk image file with [PassMark OSForensics](https://www.osforensics.com/index.html)\u2122 by using the physical disk name (eg. \\\\.\\PhysicalDrive1) or logical drive letter (eg. Z:).\n\nBy default, the image files are mounted as read only so that the original image files are not altered.\n\nOSFMount supports mounting disk image files as read/write in \"write cache\" mode. This stores all writes to a \"write cache\" (or \"delta\") file which preserves the integriy of the original disk image file.\n\nOSFMount also supports the creation of RAM disks, basically a disk mounted into RAM. This generally has a large speed benefit over using a hard disk. As such this is useful with applications requiring high speed disk access, such a database applications, games (such as game cache files) and browsers (cache files). A second benefit is security, as the disk contents are not stored on a physical hard disk (but rather in RAM) and on system shutdown the disk contents are not persistent. At the time of writing, we believe this is the fastest RAM drive software available.\n\nOSFMount supports mounting images of CDs in .ISO format , which can be useful when a particular CD is used often and the speed of access is important.\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/osfmount/readme.md)**\n  \n\n---\n\n**Click here to [Patreon-ize](https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3) the package maintainer.**\n\n---", "updated": "2024-03-22T22:18:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/osfmount/3.1.1002", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/osfmount/3.1.1002", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "osfmount", "displayName": "OSFMount (Install)", "summary": "OSFMount - Mount dd image files in Windows", "version": "3.1.1002", "icon": "https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/osfmount/osfmount_icon.jpg", "author": "PassMark\u00ae Software Pty Ltd", "downloadCount": 15070, "tags": ["osfmount", "virtual", "disk", "mount", "img", "dd", "bin", "iso", "oon", "nrg", "sdi", "aff", "afm", "afd", "vmdk", "e01", "s01", "vhd", "binary"]}
