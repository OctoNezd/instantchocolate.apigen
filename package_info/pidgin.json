{"description": "Pidgin is a chat program which lets you log into accounts on multiple chat networks simultaneously. This means that you can be chatting with friends on XMPP and sitting in an IRC channel at the same time.\n\nPidgin is compatible with the following chat networks out of the box: Jabber/XMPP, Bonjour, Gadu-Gadu, IRC, Novell GroupWise Messenger, Lotus Sametime, SILC, SIMPLE, and Zephyr. It can support many more with plugins.\n\nPidgin supports many features of these chat networks, such as file transfers, away messages, buddy icons, custom smileys, and typing notifications. Numerous plugins also extend Pidgin\u2019s functionality above and beyond the standard features.\n\n**NOTE**: This package is automatically updated. If it is out of date and there is no newer package submitted, please use the `Contact Maintainers` functionality to alert me.", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:18:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pidgin/2.14.13", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pidgin/2.14.13", "licenseUrl": "https://keep.imfreedom.org/pidgin/pidgin/file/tip/COPYING", "packageName": "pidgin", "displayName": "Pidgin", "summary": "Pidgin is a chat program which lets you log into accounts on multiple chat networks simultaneously.", "version": "2.14.13", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mikeee/ChocoPackages/icons/pidgin.png", "author": "Mark Spencer and Contributors", "downloadCount": 164444, "tags": ["pidgin", "im", "admin", "chat", "jabber", "icq", "messenger", "facebook", "bonjour", "aim", "xmpp", "irc"]}
