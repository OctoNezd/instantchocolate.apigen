{"description": "imgpkg (pronounced: \"image package\") allows you to store and distribute sets\n    of files (e.g. application configuration) as images in Docker (OCI) registries. Combine\n    your configuration files, and a list of references to images on which they depend into\n    an image that imgpkg calls a Bundle. Original primary use case for this CLI was to store\n    application configuration (i.e. templates) as an image.", "updated": "2024-03-22T22:33:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/imgpkg/0.33.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/imgpkg/0.33.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-imgpkg/blob/develop/LICENSE", "packageName": "imgpkg", "displayName": "Carvel imgpkg", "summary": "Store application configuration files in Docker/OCI registries.", "version": "0.33.0", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/adriens/chocolatey-kbld/main/img/CarvelLogo.png", "author": "Carvel", "downloadCount": 1951, "tags": ["oci", "registry", "k8s", "kubernetes", "configuration-management", "docker", "carvel", "vmware", "tanzu", "devops"]}
