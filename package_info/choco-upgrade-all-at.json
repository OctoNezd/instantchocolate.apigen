{"description": "---\n\n### [choco://choco-upgrade-all-at](choco://choco-upgrade-all-at)\nTo use choco:// protocol URLs, install [(unofficial) choco:// Protocol support ](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-protocol-support)\n\n---\n\n# DO YOU WANT TO UPGRADE YOUR CHOCOLATEY PACKAGES EVERY DAY? OR MAYBE EVERY WEEK?\n\n# YOU JUST FOUND THE EASY WAY!\n\t\n### This package creates a Windows Scheduled Task to run \"choco upgrade all -y\" with enhanced options at a time and frequency you specify. And because sometimes package installations go wrong... it will also create a Windows Scheduled Task to run \"taskkill /im choco.exe /f /t\" to stop the Chocolatey (choco.exe) process and all child processes at a time you specify.\n\nThis package is a pseudo replacement for [choco-upgrade-all-at-startup](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at-startup).\n\n### USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n* You can do nothing and it will run at the set it and forget it time. :)\n* You can manually run **choco-upgrade-all** from Command Prompt or PowerShell.\n* You can manually click the Upgrade All Packages icon in the Chocolatey Start Menu group if you have [choco-shortcuts-winconfig](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-shortcuts-winconfig) installed.\n* You can manually run **choco-install packagename** from Command Prompt or PowerShell to install packages with your **choco-upgrade-all-at** settings.\n\n### INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can install **choco-upgrade-all-at** with multiple parameters to make it run \"choco upgrade all -y\" daily or weekly (Monthly is just not often enough!) at your preferred time. If you enter no parameters at all, **choco-upgrade-all-at** will default to run \"choco upgrade all -y\" at 2 AM every day and abort the process at 4 AM. When entering the TIME and ABORTTIME parameters, use \"[Military Time](http://militarytimechart.com/).\" When entering the DAILY or WEEKLY parameter you can actually use anything, \"yes\" just makes sense though. When using the WEEKLY parameter, DAYS are entered as MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, or SUN. Not entering the correct format will fail the install. Please see the examples below.\n\n### INSTALL EXAMPLES:\n* **choco install choco-upgrade-all-at --params \"'/TIME:23:00'\"** - runs \"choco upgrade all -y\" daily (default) at 11 PM and aborts at 1 AM, ABORTTIME defaults to +2 hours.\n* **choco install choco-upgrade-all-at --params \"'/DAILY:yes /TIME:04:00 /ABORTTIME:08:00'\"** - runs \"choco upgrade all -y\" daily at 4 AM and aborts it at 8 AM.\n* **choco install choco-upgrade-all-at --params \"'/WEEKLY:yes /DAY:SUN /TIME:01:00'\"** - runs \"choco upgrade all -y\" every Sunday at 1 AM and aborts at 3 AM.\n* **choco install choco-upgrade-all-at --params \"'/NOTASK:true'\"** - installs choco-upgrade-all.ps1/bat without the scheduled task.\n\n### CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS:\nRun **choco-upgrade-all -EditConfig** to enable enhanced options such as:\n* automatically delete newly installed Desktop and Start Menu icons\n* run pre and/or post processing scripts\n* setting a default user profile\n\n### SEE THE RELEASE NOTES FOR MORE INFORMATION\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/choco-upgrade-all-at/readme.md)**\n\n**If you find choco-upgrade-all-at useful, and I suspect you will, please consider donating: https://www.paypal.me/bcurran3donations or become a patron at https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3**", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:18:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at/0.0.7", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/choco-upgrade-all-at/0.0.7", "licenseUrl": "https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Public_domain", "packageName": "choco-upgrade-all-at", "displayName": "(unofficial) Choco Upgrade All at (Task)", "summary": "choco-upgrade-all-at will create a Windows Scheduled Task to upgrade your Chocolatey packages daily", "version": "0.0.7", "icon": "https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/choco-upgrade-all-at/choco-upgrade-all-at_icon.png", "author": "bcurran3", "downloadCount": 264655, "tags": ["bcurran3", "unofficial", "choco", "upgrade", "all", "cup", "config", "schtasks", "scheduled", "task"]}
