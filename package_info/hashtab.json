The new tab called \u201cFile Hashes\u201d is Hashtab! \n    \n#### Features\n* Calculate and display hash values from over two dozen popular hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA1, SHA2, RipeMD, HAVAL and Whirlpool.  Now, SHA3 too!\n* The hash comparison tool supports drag and drop, copy and paste and even has a built-in browse option. \n* Translated into 27 languages and counting, Hashtab has been downloaded millions of times from over 200 different countries.\n* The perfect way to validate the integrity of a file download.
