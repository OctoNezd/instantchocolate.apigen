{"description": "Make JSON greppable!\n\ngron transforms JSON into discrete assignments to make it easier to `grep` for what you want and see the absolute 'path' to it.\nIt eases the exploration of APIs that return large blobs of JSON but have terrible documentation.\n\n```\n\u25b6 gron \"https://api.github.com/repos/tomnomnom/gron/commits?per_page=1\" | fgrep \"commit.author\"\njson[0].commit.author = {};\njson[0].commit.author.date = \"2016-07-02T10:51:21Z\";\njson[0].commit.author.email = \"mail@tomnomnom.com\";\njson[0].commit.author.name = \"Tom Hudson\";\n```\n\ngron can work backwards too, enabling you to turn your filtered data back into JSON:\n```\n\u25b6 gron \"https://api.github.com/repos/tomnomnom/gron/commits?per_page=1\" | fgrep \"commit.author\" | gron --ungron\n[\n  {\n    \"commit\": {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"date\": \"2016-07-02T10:51:21Z\",\n        \"email\": \"mail@tomnomnom.com\",\n        \"name\": \"Tom Hudson\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n> Disclaimer: the GitHub API has fantastic documentation, but it makes for a good example.", "updated": "2024-03-21T00:48:59Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gron/0.7.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/gron/0.7.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "gron", "displayName": "gron", "summary": "Make JSON greppable!", "version": "0.7.1", "icon": "", "author": "Tom Hudson", "downloadCount": 1847, "tags": ["command-line", "json", "grep", "cross-platform", "foss"]}
