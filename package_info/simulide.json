{"description": "# SimulIDE 0.3.10\n\nElectronic Circuit Simulator\n\nSimulIDE is a simple real time electronic circuit simulator.\n\nIt's intended for general purpose electronics and microcontroller simulation, supporting PIC, AVR and Arduino.\n\nPIC simulation is provided by gpsim and avr simulation by simavr.\n\nThis is not an accurate simulator for circuit analisis, it aims to be the fast, simple and easy to use, so this means simple and not very accurate electronic models and limited features.\n\nIntended for hobbist or students to learn and experiment with simple circuits.\n\n\nSimulIDE also features a code Editor and Debugger for GcBasic, Arduino, PIC asm and AVR asm.\nEditor/Debugger is still in it's firsts stages of development, with basic functionalities, but it is possible to write, compile and basic debugging with breakpoints, watch registers and global variables.\n\n**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is\nout of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and\nlet them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-22T23:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/simulide/0.3.10.20190412", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/simulide/0.3.10.20190412", "licenseUrl": "https://sourceforge.net/p/simulide/svnrepo/HEAD/tree/trunk/COPYING", "packageName": "simulide", "displayName": "SimulIDE", "summary": "Electronic Circuit Simulator", "version": "0.3.10.20190412", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mkevenaar/chocolatey-packages@ab172920222bd8bb7e28a2f579b5e5d7e08de895/icons/simulide.png", "author": "SimulIDE", "downloadCount": 1064, "tags": ["simulide", "simulator"]}
