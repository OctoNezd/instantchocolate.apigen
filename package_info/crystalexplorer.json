{"description": "CrystalExplorer is a versatile and powerful tool for investigating intermolecular interactions and packing in crystalline materials using the full suite of Hirshfeld surface tools and ab initio quantum mechanical calculations.  It can be used to investigate many areas of solid-state chemistry including:\n\n* Intermolecular interactions\n* Polymorphism\n* Effects of pressure and temperature on crystal structures\n* Single-crystal to Single-crystal reactions\n* Analyzing crystal voids\n* Structure-property relationships \n\nBy mapping the ab initio quantum mechanical property densities and other distance- and curvature-related metrics on Hirshfeld surfaces, CrystalExplorer provides unique insights into the in-crystal environment.\n\nA recent feature in this version is the ability to display and quantify voids in crystal structures. \n\n### License required\n\nCrystalExplorer requires a license to run.
