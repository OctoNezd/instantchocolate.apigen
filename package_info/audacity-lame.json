{"description": "LAME is a high quality MPEG Audio Layer III (MP3) encoder licensed under the LGPL.\n\nLAME is considered the best MP3 encoder at mid-high bitrates and at VBR, mostly thanks to the dedicated work of its developers and the open source licensing model that allowed the project to tap into engineering resources from all around the world. Both quality and speed improvements are still happening, probably making LAME the only MP3 encoder still being actively developed. \n\n** Use this package to install the LAME MP3 library for Audacity. **\n\nMore info: http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html#lame", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/audacity-lame/3.100.0.20190331", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/audacity-lame/3.100.0.20190331", "licenseUrl": "http://lame.sourceforge.net/license.txt", "packageName": "audacity-lame", "displayName": "LAME for Audacity", "summary": "LAME MP3 Encoder for Audacity", "version": "3.100.0.20190331", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages/master/Icons/audacity-lame_icon.png", "author": "Arturo Busleiman (build),  Robert Hegemann,  Alexander Leidinger,  Rog\u00e9rio Brito", "downloadCount": 199189, "tags": ["audacity-lame", "audacity", "lame", "mp3", "encoder", "music"]}
