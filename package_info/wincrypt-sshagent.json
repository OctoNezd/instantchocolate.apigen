{"description": "## Introduction\n\nA SSH Agent based-on Windows CryptoAPI.\n\nThis project allows other programs to access SSH keys stored in your Windows Certificate Store for authentication.\n\nBenefit by Windows Certificate Management, this project natively supports the use of windows user certificates or smart cards, e.g., Yubikey PIV, for authentication.\n\n## Feature\n\n* Work with smart cards natively without installing any driver in Windows (PIV only)\n* Support for OpenSSH certificates (so you can use your smart card with an additional OpenSSH certificate)\n* Good compatibility\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThere are many different OpenSSH agent implementations in Windows. This project implements five popular protocols in Windows:\n\n* Cygwin UNIX Socket\n* Windows UNIX Socket (Windows 10 1803 or later)\n* Named pipe\n* Pageant SSH Agent Protocol\n* XShell Xagent Protocol\n\nWith the support of these protocols, this project is compatible with most SSH clients in Windows. For example:\n\n* Git for Windows\n* Windows Subsystem for Linux\n* Windows OpenSSH\n* Putty\n* Jetbrains\n* SecureCRT\n* XShell\n* Cygwin\n* MINGW\n* ...", "updated": "2024-03-23T17:33:37Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/wincrypt-sshagent/1.1.9", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/wincrypt-sshagent/1.1.9", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "wincrypt-sshagent", "displayName": "wincrypt-sshagent (Install)", "summary": "Using a Yubikey for SSH Authentication Seamlessly!", "version": "1.1.9", "icon": "", "author": "buptczq", "downloadCount": 5061, "tags": ["wincrypt-sshagent", "ssh", "yubikey", "smartcard"]}
