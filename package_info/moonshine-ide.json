{"description": "Why Moonshine?\n\n\t- Works with feature parity on the cloud model\n\n\tThe first IDE developed to provide cloud support for ActionScript 3 , Apache Flex\u00ae, Apache Royale\u00ae and Feathers. Now you can create your projects on the cloud and utilize the agility of a cloud based platform using Moonshine IDE.\n\n\t- 100% Cross Platform\n\n\tMoonshine is a cross platform open source application. With Moonshine you will find the luxury of developing anywhere on any platform.\n\n\t- Built specifically to focus on Apache Flex\u00ae and Royale\u00ae\n\n\tThe Apache Royale\u00ae is a continuation of the previous effort called FlexJS to produce a next-generation of the Apache Flex\u00ae SDK that enables developers to use MXML and ActionScript to generate HTML/JS/CSS applications which can run natively in browsers. The cross-compiled code can also be used in Apache Cordova\u00ae (Adobe PhoneGap) mobile applications.\n\n\t- Subversion support\n\n\tWe are providing SLIKSVN for subversion support because they provide a standalone command-line Subversion client for Windows. The installer contains all command line tools (svn, svnadmin, svnsync, svnserve, svnmucc) without application bindings or Apache modules.
