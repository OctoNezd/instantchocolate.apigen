{"description": "Lzip can compress about as fast as gzip (lzip -0), or compress most files more than bzip2 (lzip -9). Decompression speed is intermediate between gzip and bzip2. Lzip is better than gzip and bzip2 from a data recovery perspective.\n\nThe lzip file format is designed for data sharing and long-term archiving, taking into account both data integrity and decoder availability:\n\n* The lzip format provides very safe integrity checking and some data recovery means. The lziprecover program can repair bit-flip errors (one of the most common forms of data corruption) in lzip files, and provides data recovery capabilities, including error-checked merging of damaged copies of a file.\n* The lzip format is as simple as possible (but not simpler). The lzip manual provides the source code of a simple decompressor along with a detailed explanation of how it works, so that with the only help of the lzip manual it would be possible for a digital archaeologist to extract the data from a lzip file long after quantum computers eventually render LZMA obsolete.\n* Additionally the lzip reference implementation is copylefted, which guarantees that it will remain free forever.", "updated": "2024-03-21T08:49:00Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/lzip/1.19", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/lzip/1.19", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "packageName": "lzip", "displayName": "lzip", "summary": "Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to the one of gzip or bzip2", "version": "1.19", "icon": "", "author": "Antonio Diaz Diaz", "downloadCount": 2047, "tags": ["lzip", "compression", "admin"]}
