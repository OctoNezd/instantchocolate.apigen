{"description": "The Monaspace type system is a monospaced type superfamily with some modern\n            tricks up its sleeve. It consists of five variable axis typefaces. Each one has a\n            distinct voice, but they are all metrics-compatible with one another, allowing you to\n            mix and match them for a more expressive typographical palette.\n\n            Letters on a grid is how we see our code. Why not make those letters better?\n\n            [installargs]\n\n            For further details on setup and configuration for your system, see [the\n            README](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace#readme).", "updated": "2024-03-21T16:03:40Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/monaspace/1.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/monaspace/1.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/blob/main/LICENSE", "packageName": "monaspace", "displayName": "Monaspace", "summary": "An innovative superfamily of fonts for code", "version": "1.0.0", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/jpruskin/ChocolateyPackages/master/icons/monaspace.png", "author": "GitHub Next", "downloadCount": 166, "tags": ["font", "otf", "monospace", "typography"]}
