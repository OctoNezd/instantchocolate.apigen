{"description": "MultiMarkdown, or MMD, is a tool to help turn minimally marked-up plain text\ninto well formatted documents, including HTML, PDF (by way of [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)),\n[OPML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML), or OpenDocument (specifically, Flat [OpenDocument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument) or \u2018.fodt\u2019, which\ncan in turn be converted into [RTF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format), Microsoft Word, or virtually any other\nword-processing format).\n\nMMD is a superset of the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax, originally created by John Gruber.\nIt adds multiple syntax features (tables, footnotes, and citations, to name a\nfew), in addition to the various output formats listed above (Markdown only\ncreates HTML). Additionally, it builds in \u201csmart\u201d typography for various\nlanguages (proper left- and right-sided quotes, for example).", "updated": "2024-03-21T11:48:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/multimarkdown/6.4.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/multimarkdown/6.4.0", "licenseUrl": "https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT", "packageName": "multimarkdown", "displayName": "MultiMarkdown", "summary": "A tool to help turn minimally marked-up plain text into well formatted documents", "version": "6.4.0", "icon": "", "author": "Fletcher Penney", "downloadCount": 1926, "tags": ["multimarkdown", "markdown", "latex", "pdf", "epub", "html"]}
