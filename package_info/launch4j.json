{"description": "Launch4j is a cross-platform tool for wrapping Java applications distributed as jars in lightweight Windows native executables.\n     The executable can be configured to search for a certain JRE version or use a bundled one, and it's possible to set runtime options, like the initial/max heap size.\n     The wrapper also provides better user experience through an application icon, a native pre-JRE splash screen, and a Java download page in case the appropriate JRE cannot be found.", "updated": "2024-03-22T09:48:41Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/launch4j/3.14", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/launch4j/3.14", "licenseUrl": "http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause", "packageName": "launch4j", "displayName": "launch4j (Install)", "summary": "Launch4j converts JAR files to EXE files", "version": "3.14", "icon": "", "author": "Grzegorz Kowal", "downloadCount": 1107, "tags": ["launch4j", "java2exe", "javatoexe", "javaexe", "java", "exe"]}
