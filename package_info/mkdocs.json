{"description": "MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.\n\n## Features\n\n* **Host anywhere:** MkDocs builds completely static HTML sites that you can host on GitHub pages, Amazon S3, or [anywhere](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/) else you choose.\n* **Great themes available:** There's a stack of good looking themes available for MkDocs. Choose between the built in themes: [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/styling-your-docs/#mkdocs) and [readthedocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/styling-your-docs/#readthedocs), select one of the 3rd party themes in the [MkDocs wiki](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Themes), or [build your own](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/custom-themes/).\n* **Preview your site as you work:** The built-in dev-server allows you to preview your documentation as you're writing it. It will even auto-reload and refresh your browser whenever you save your changes.\n* **Easy to customize:** Get your project documentation looking just the way you want it by customizing the theme.", "updated": "2024-03-23T11:18:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/mkdocs/1.5.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/mkdocs/1.5.3", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "mkdocs", "displayName": "MkDocs", "summary": "Project documentation with Markdown.", "version": "1.5.3", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages@45d7d88c15fb38a55f15ef9ecf39b356cdbadabd/icons/mkdocs.png", "author": "Tom Christie", "downloadCount": 20216, "tags": ["mkdocs", "markdown", "documentation", "foss", "cross-platform", "cli"]}
