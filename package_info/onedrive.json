{"description": "With OneDrive, you can sync files between your computer and the cloud, so you can get to your files from anywhere - your computer, your mobile device, and even through the OneDrive website at OneDrive.com. If you add, change, or delete a file or folder in your OneDrive folder, the file or folder is added, changed, or deleted on the OneDrive website and vice versa. You can work with your synced files directly in File Explorer and access your files even when you\u2019re offline. Whenever you\u2019re online, any changes that you or others make will sync automatically.\n    \n### Note\nThis package is for a machine-wide install of Microsoft OneDrive.  Installing this package will disable the default, per-user, first-login install of OneDrive for Windows 10, and uninstalling this package will re-enable that **for new users only**.\n\nAlso, this package is only for Windows 10 or Server 2016 and up.  While it may be possible to manually install OneDrive Sync client on earlier OS versions, it is unsupported.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/onedrive/24.25.204.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/onedrive/24.25.204.3", "licenseUrl": "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/", "packageName": "onedrive", "displayName": "Microsoft OneDrive Sync Client", "summary": "Any file, anywhere, always protected", "version": "24.25.204.3", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages@3ecd8fd600c16dfcb9bb0a8e43819c2b52ca9ce1/Icons/onedrive_icon.png", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 2139238, "tags": ["onedrive", "backup", "cloud", "sync", "office", "office365", "microsoft365"]}
