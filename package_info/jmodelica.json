{"description": "The main objective of the project is to create an industrially viable open source platform for simulation and optimization of Modelica models, while offering a flexible platform serving as a virtual lab for algorithm development and research. As such, JModelica.org provides a platform for technology transfer where industrially relevant problems can inspire new research and where state of the art algorithms can be propagated from academia into industrial use. JModelica.org is a result of research at the [Department of Automatic Control](http://www.control.lth.se), Lund University, and is now maintained and developed by [Modelon AB](http://www.modelon.se) in collaboration with academia. \n\nJModelica.org is distributed under the GPL v.3 license approved by the [Open Source Initiative](http://www.opensource.org).\n\nJModelica.org at a glance:\n\n- *_Model_* your systems using the object-oriented and equation-based language Modelica\n- *_Solve_* your complex simulation and optimization problems using state of the art numerical algorithms\n- *_Automate_* your work in the Python scripting environment\n- *_Visualize_* your results\n\nJModelica.org is compliant with the Modelica Standard Library.", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:18:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/jmodelica/2.14", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/jmodelica/2.14", "licenseUrl": "https://jmodelica.org/", "packageName": "jmodelica", "displayName": "JModelica", "summary": "JModelica.org is an extensible [Modelica-based](http://www.modelica.org) open source platform for optimization, simulation and analysis of complex dynamic systems.", "version": "2.14", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/jmodelica/jmodelica.png", "author": "JModelica.org is a result of research at the Department of Automatic Control,  Lund University,  and is now maintained and developed by Modelon AB in collaboration with academia.", "downloadCount": 827, "tags": ["jmodelica", "modelica", "optimization", "simulation", "analysis", "complex", "dynamic", "system"]}
