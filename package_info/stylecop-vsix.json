{"description": "StyleCop analyzes C# source code to enforce a set of style and consistency rules.\n\nThis extension allows analysis to be performed on any project opened in Visual Studio 2013-2017 without modifying the project.\n\nAlternatively, the [StyleCop.MSBuild NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StyleCop.MSBuild) can be added to a project to allow analysis to be performed during the project build without installing any Visual Studio extensions.\n\nThis package is a successor of the [classic StyleCop package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/stylecop), which bundled all StyleCop bits in a single MSI. It allows existing projects already using StyleCop to use modern Visual Studio versions and at least some of the recent C# language features. No major development is planned, however, and developers are [encouraged](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChrisDahlberg.StyleCop#qna) to consider using something like [StyleCopAnalyzers](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers) going forward.", "updated": "2024-03-22T07:48:45Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/stylecop-vsix/5.0.6419.20180518", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/stylecop-vsix/5.0.6419.20180518", "licenseUrl": "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/ChrisDahlberg.StyleCop/license", "packageName": "stylecop-vsix", "displayName": "StyleCop extension for Visual Studio", "summary": "StyleCop analyzes C# source code to enforce a set of style and consistency rules.", "version": "5.0.6419.20180518", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/jberezanski/ChocolateyPackages/6b020a7becf2fb65d21d31165e994bf040397f5c/icons/stylecop.png", "author": "Chris Dahlberg,  Andy Reeves", "downloadCount": 2274, "tags": ["stylecop", "source", "analysis", "visual", "studio", "extension", "vsix", "admin"]}
