{"description": "Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework created and maintained by the National Security Agency Research Directorate. This framework includes a suite of full-featured, high-end software analysis tools that enable users to analyze compiled code on a variety of platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Capabilities include disassembly, assembly, decompilation, graphing, and scripting, along with hundreds of other features. Ghidra supports a wide variety of processor instruction sets and executable formats and can be run in both user-interactive and automated modes. Users may also develop their own Ghidra plug-in components and/or scripts using Java or Python.\n\n      In support of NSA's Cybersecurity mission, Ghidra was built to solve scaling and teaming problems on complex SRE efforts, and to provide a customizable and extensible SRE research platform. NSA has applied Ghidra SRE capabilities to a variety of problems that involve analyzing malicious code and generating deep insights for SRE analysts who seek a better understanding of potential vulnerabilities in networks and systems.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ghidra/11.0.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ghidra/11.0.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "ghidra", "displayName": "Ghidra", "summary": "A software reverse engineering (SRE) suite of tools developed by NSA's Research Directorate in support of the Cybersecurity mission.", "version": "11.0.1", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/eugbaranov/chocolatey-packages/a62dad79/ghidra/GHIDRA_1.png", "author": "National Security Agency", "downloadCount": 97715, "tags": ["reverse", "engineering", "infosec", "security", "cybersecurity"]}
