{"description": "# diskus\nA minimal, fast alternative to `du -sh`.\n\n`diskus` is a very simple program that computes the total size of the current directory. It is a parallelized version of `du -sh`. On my 8-core laptop, it is about ten times faster than `du` with a cold disk cache and more than three times faster with a warm disk cache.\n\n```\n$ diskus\n9.59 GB (9,587,408,896 bytes)\n```\n\n## Windows caveats\n\nWindows-internal tools such as Powershell, Explorer or `dir` are not respecting hardlinks or\njunction points when determining the size of a directory. `diskus` does the same and counts\nsuch entries multiple times (on Unix systems, multiple hardlinks to a single file are counted\njust once).", "updated": "2024-03-08T13:19:07Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/diskus/0.7.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/diskus/0.7.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/sharkdp/diskus#license", "packageName": "diskus", "displayName": "diskus", "summary": "A minimal, fast alternative to `du -sh`.", "version": "0.7.0", "icon": "", "author": "David Peter", "downloadCount": 133, "tags": ["disk", "usage", "parallel", "space", "free", "directory", "du", "terminal", "cli", "file", "utility", "commandline", "cross-platform"]}
