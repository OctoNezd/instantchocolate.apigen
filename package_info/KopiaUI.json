Kopia does not 'image' your whole machine. Rather, Kopia allows you to backup/restore any and all files/directories that you deem are important or critical.\n\nKopia has both [CLI (command-line interface)](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#both-command-line-and-graphical-user-interfaces) and [GUI (graphical user interface)](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#both-command-line-and-graphical-user-interfaces) versions, making it the perfect tool for both advanced and regular users. You can read more about Kopia's unique [features](https://kopia.io/docs/features/) -- which include [compression](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#compression), [deduplication](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#backup-files-and-directories-using-snapshots), [end-to-end 'zero knowledge' encryption](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#end-to-end-zero-knowledge-encryption), and [error correction](https://kopia.io/docs/features/#error-correction) -- to get a better understanding of how Kopia works.\n\nWhen ready, head to the [installation](https://kopia.io/docs/installation/) page to download and install Kopia, and make sure to read the [Getting Started Guide](https://kopia.io/docs/getting-started/) for a step-by-step walkthrough of how to use Kopia.", "updated": "2024-03-23T10:33:43Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/KopiaUI/0.15.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/KopiaUI/0.15.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/kopia/kopia/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "KopiaUI", "displayName": "Kopia UI", "summary": "Cross-platform backup tool for Windows, macOS & Linux with fast, incremental backups, client-side end-to-end encryption, compression and data deduplication.
