{"description": "diff-pdf is a tool for visually comparing two PDFs.\n\nIt takes two PDF files as arguments. By default, its only output is its return\ncode, which is 0 if there are no differences and 1 if the two PDFs differ. If\ngiven the `--output-diff` option, it produces a PDF file with visually\nhighlighted differences:\n\n```\n$ diff-pdf --output-diff=diff.pdf a.pdf b.pdf\n```\n\nAnother option is to compare the two files visually in a simple GUI, using\nthe `--view` argument:\n\n```\n$ diff-pdf --view a.pdf b.pdf\n```\n\nThis opens a window that lets you view the files' pages and zoom in on details.\nIt is also possible to shift the two pages relatively to each other using\nCtrl-arrows (Cmd-arrows on MacOS). This is useful for identifying translation-only differences.\n\nSee the output of `$ diff-pdf --help` for complete list of options.", "updated": "2024-03-23T16:03:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/diff-pdf/0.5.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/diff-pdf/0.5.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/vslavik/diff-pdf/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "diff-pdf", "displayName": "diff-pdf (Portable)", "summary": "diff-pdf is a command line tool for visually comparing two PDFs.", "version": "0.5.1", "icon": "", "author": "Vaclav Slavik", "downloadCount": 740, "tags": ["diff-pdf", "pdf", "diff", "command-line", "compare"]}
