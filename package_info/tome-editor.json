{"description": "Developing games is all about data. With game systems for modifying data and user interfaces for presenting it, finding a sophisticated data model is key to creating successful games. Even more, being able to change this data and iterate on a day-to-day basis is mandatory in today's production cycles.\n\nTome solves two problems that arise with every new game you build: First, you can import the definition of your game's data so game designers can create new data records and modify existing ones very conveniently. Second, you can export the results to any format your game engine understands.", "updated": "2024-03-11T12:18:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/tome-editor/1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/tome-editor/1.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/npruehs/tome-editor/blob/develop/LICENSE", "packageName": "tome-editor", "displayName": "Tome", "summary": "A generic data editor for games supporting arbitrary input and output formats.", "version": "1.0", "icon": "https://github.com/npruehs/tome-editor/raw/develop/Media/Icons/Tome.png", "author": "Nick Pr\u00fchs", "downloadCount": 2306, "tags": ["tome", "game", "data", "editor"]}
