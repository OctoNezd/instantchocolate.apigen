{"description": "RBTray is a small Windows program that runs in the background and allows almost any window to be minimized to the system tray by:\n\n* Right-clicking its minimize button\n* Shift-right-clicking its title bar\n* Using the Control-Alt-Down hotkey\n\nNote that not all of these methods will work for every window, so please use whichever one works for your needs.\n\n### Install options\nBy default, this package will install rbtray to start upon login for any user.  If you would prefer to have rbtray start only on user request, use the package parameter, `/NoAutoStart`.\n\nIn some cases, the first two methods of \"tray-ifying\" windows can cause problems with some software because of they way they intercept (or \"hook\") mouse events.  If you believe this will be an issue, you can use a `/NoHook` package parameter and the Start Menu icon will be configured so that RBTray only activates via the `CTRL-ALT-DOWN` method.\n\n##### example\n\n* `choco install rbtray --params '\"/NoAutoStart /NoHook\"'`", "updated": "2024-03-22T01:33:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rbtray/4.14", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/rbtray/4.14", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/benbuck/rbtray/blob/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "rbtray", "displayName": "RBTray", "summary": "Minimize windows to the system tray", "version": "4.14", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages@1e414c2174c5dd72d37045f045fa66dd1f0e6af2/Icons/rbtray_icon.png", "author": "Nikolay Redko,  J.D.
