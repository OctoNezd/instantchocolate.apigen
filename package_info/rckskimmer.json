{"description": "RCKskimmer is able to search for digital signals (RTTY, BPSK31, BPSK63 and BPSK125) in a FFT-spectrum of a standard receiver like K3, FT1000x, ... or a SDR receiver with a NF-connection to the soundcard of the PC by using the MMVARI module.\n\nAll bands and frequencies can be scanned in a row.\n\nAll callsigns with CQ, QRZ, DE or TEST will be detected and listed with exactly mark-frequency by using the OmniRig Transceiver Control by VE3NEA, thanks Alex.\n\nThe callsigns are posted in real time to the RCK - Digital-Cluster-System what is specially designed for RCKskimmer and accessable for everyone and the spots are going also to the [www.reversebeacon.net](http://www.reversebeacon.net) network.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/manual/rckskimmer/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-22T20:03:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rckskimmer/3.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/rckskimmer/3.2", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "rckskimmer", "displayName": "RCKskimmer", "summary": "RCKskimmer is able to search for digital signals (RTTY, BPSK31, BPSK63 and BPSK125) in a FFT-spectrum of a standard receiver like K3, FT1000x, ... or a SDR receiver with a NF-connection to the soundcard of the PC by using the MMVARI module.", "version": "3.2", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/manual/rckskimmer/rckskimmer.png", "author": "Walter Dallmeier DL4RCK", "downloadCount": 439, "tags": ["rckskimmer", "HAM", "radio", "amateur", "digital", "signal", "RTTY", "BPSK31", "BPSK63", "BPSK125"]}
