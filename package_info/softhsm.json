{"description": "SoftHSM is an implementation of a cryptographic store accessible through a PKCS #11 interface. You can use it to explore PKCS #11 without having a Hardware Security Module. It is being developed as a part of the OpenDNSSEC project. SoftHSM uses Botan for its cryptographic operations.\n\n**Background**\n\nOpenDNSSEC handles and stores its cryptographic keys via the PKCS #11 interface. This interface specifies how to communicate with cryptographic devices such as HSM:s (Hardware Security Modules) and smart cards. The purpose of these devices is, among others, to generate cryptographic keys and sign information without revealing private-key material to the outside world. They are often designed to perform well on these specific tasks compared to ordinary processes in a normal computer.\n\nA potential problem with the use of the PKCS #11 interface is that it might limit the wide spread use of OpenDNSSEC, since a potential user might not be willing to invest in a new hardware device. To counter this effect, OpenDNSSEC is providing a software implementation of a generic cryptographic device with a PKCS#11 interface, the SoftHSM. SoftHSM is designed to meet the requirements of OpenDNSSEC, but can also work together with other cryptographic products because of the PKCS #11 interface.", "updated": "2024-03-19T16:03:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/softhsm/2.5.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/softhsm/2.5.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendnssec/SoftHSMv2/develop/LICENSE", "packageName": "softhsm", "displayName": "SoftHSM", "summary": "SoftHSM is an implementation of a cryptographic store accessible through a PKCS #11 interface.
