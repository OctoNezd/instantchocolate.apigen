{"description": "Every hard disk is too small if you just wait long enough. TreeSize Free tells you where precious disk space has gone.\n\nTreeSize Free can be started from the context menu of a folder or drive and shows you the size of this folder, including its subfolders. Expand folders in an Explorer-like fashion and see the size of every subfolder. All results can also be drilled down to the file level. Scanning operations run in a thread, so you can already see results while TreeSize Free is working. The Explorer context menu is supported within TreeSize, as well as the usual drag & drop operations.\n\nInstallation instructions:\nTreeSize Free is automatically installed in English to \"Program Files\\JAM Software\\TreeSize Free\" (32 Bit) or to \"Program Files (x86)\\JAM Software\\TreeSize Free\" (64 Bit).\nThere are two parameter you can give to the installer if you add \"-params\" to the installation command:\n\n1. \"/dir=Your_Dir\"\nChanges the installation location to \"Your_Dir\".\n\n2. \"/lang=DE\"\nChanges the language from English to German. There are no other supported languages.\n\nExample:\ncinst treesizefree -params \"/dir=C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Admin Tools\\ /lang=de\"", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/treesizefree/4.7.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/treesizefree/4.7.2", "licenseUrl": "https://www.jam-software.com/company/freeware_license.shtml", "packageName": "treesizefree", "displayName": "TreeSize Free", "summary": "Every hard disk is too small if you just wait long enough.
