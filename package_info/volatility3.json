{"description": "Volatility is the world's most widely used framework for extracting digital\nartifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples. The extraction techniques are\nperformed completely independent of the system being investigated but offer\nvisibility into the runtime state of the system. The framework is intended\nto introduce people to the techniques and complexities associated with\nextracting digital artifacts from volatile memory samples and provide a\nplatform for further work into this exciting area of research.\n\nIn 2019, the Volatility Foundation released a complete rewrite of the\nframework, Volatility 3. The project was intended to address many of the\ntechnical and performance challenges associated with the original\ncode base that became apparent over the previous 10 years. Another benefit\nof the rewrite is that Volatility 3 could be released under a custom\nlicense that was more aligned with the goals of the Volatility community,\nthe Volatility Software License (VSL).
