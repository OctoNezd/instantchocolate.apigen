{"description": "PRAAT is a very flexible tool for speech analysis. It offers a wide range of standard and non-standard procedures including spectrographic analysis, articulatory synthesis, and neural networks.  There is simply no better package for linguists to use in analyzing speech.\n    \n### Features\n* Speech analysis\n* Speech synthesis\n* Speech manipulation\n* Listening experiments\n* Labeling and segmentation\n* Learning algorithms\n* Statistics with principal compenent and discriminant analysis\n* Produce quality graphics with integrated Mathematical and phonetics symbols\n* Programmable with an easy scripting language\n* Portable\n* Configurable\n\nFor best results with phonetic characters in the TextGrid and Picture windows, you should also consider installing the [Charis SIL](https://chocolatey.org/packages/charissil) and/or the [Doulos SIL](https://chocolatey.org/packages/doulossil) fonts.\n\nMuch of the \"official\" documentation is not designed to help linguists (who may not have a strong phonetics background) get the measurements and make the changes that they need for research.  Thus, be sure to also look at the regularly-updated guidebook, [*Using Praat for Linguistic Research* by Will Styler](http://savethevowels.org/praat/) or [*Welcome to SWPhonetics* by Sidney Wood](https://swphonetics.com/praat/introduction/).", "updated": "2024-03-23T05:03:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/praat/6.4.6", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/praat/6.4.6", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/praat/praat/blob/master/main/GNU_General_Public_License.txt", "packageName": "praat", "displayName": "Praat", "summary": "Doing phonetics by computer", "version": "6.4.6", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages@f5df8275154486951e8b6876902a2a2dd7af5525/Icons/praat_icon.png", "author": "Paul Boersma,  David Weenink", "downloadCount": 45271, "tags": ["praat", "sound", "visualization", "speech", "phonetics", "phonology", "analysis", "oss", "embedded"]}
