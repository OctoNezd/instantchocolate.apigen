{"description": "OnionShare lets you securely and anonymously share files of any size. It works by starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor onion service, and generating an unguessable URL to access and download the files. It doesn't require setting up a server on the internet somewhere or using a third party file-sharing service. You host the file on your own computer and use a Tor onion service to make it temporarily accessible over the internet. The other user just needs to use Tor Browser to download the file from you.\n\n### Notes\n\n- Versions prior to 2.3 will not get uninstalled automatically by this package, due to problems with the uninstaller not running unattended. Please remove OnionShare manually before installing this package.", "updated": "2024-03-23T17:18:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/onionshare/2.6", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/onionshare/2.6", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/blob/v2.6/LICENSE", "packageName": "onionshare", "displayName": "OnionShare", "summary": "OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share a file of any size.", "version": "2.6", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AdmiringWorm/chocolatey-packages@c17eafc7449264771b68e5854e6b952371c6b517/automatic/onionshare/icons/128x128.png", "author": "Micah Lee", "downloadCount": 32984, "tags": ["onionshare", "sharing", "security", "privacy"]}
