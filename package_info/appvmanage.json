{"description": "AppV_Manage is the tool of choice for people packaging in App-V 5 for performing the initial tests on recently sequenced packages.  It is used on an App-V client test machine, and requires no back-end servers (although a file share where the packages are stored is typically used). You sequence, copy the package up to the share, and bounce over to the client to test.", "updated": "2024-03-20T06:03:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/appvmanage/5.0.1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/appvmanage/5.0.1.0", "licenseUrl": "http://www.tmurgent.com/appv/index.php/resources/AppV_Manage/225-appv-manage-installation", "packageName": "appvmanage", "displayName": "AppV Manage", "summary": "AppV_Manage is the tool of choice for people packaging in App-V 5.", "version": "5.0.1.0", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/iainbrighton/Chocolatey-Packages/1635689823f6d605e107ef4c536b4166f8634589/AppVManage/AppVManage.png", "author": "TMurgent Technologies", "downloadCount": 3730, "tags": ["App-V", "AppV"]}
