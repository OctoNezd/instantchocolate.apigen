{"description": "**MIDI2LR** is an application that interfaces MIDI controllers with Lightroom 6+/CC classic. It processes MIDI input into develop parameter updates and photo actions, and sends MIDI output when parameters are changed for motorized feedback (on controllers that have motorized faders). [A listing of available Lightroom commands is in the Wiki](https://github.com/rsjaffe/MIDI2LR/wiki). Assistance on the code and design is welcome.\n\n[See releases for MD5 and SHA checksums](https://github.com/rsjaffe/MIDI2LR/releases). MIDI2LR supports all languages Lightroom supports.\n\n**N!B!** I've only wrapped the original installator into a Chocolatey package.
