{"description": "`just` is a handy way to save and run project-specific commands.\n\nThis readme is also available as a [book](https://just.systems/man/en/).\n\n(\u4e2d\u6587\u6587\u6863\u5728 [\u8fd9\u91cc](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/README.\u4e2d\u6587.md), \u5feb\u770b\u8fc7\u6765!)\n\nCommands, called recipes, are stored in a file called `justfile` with syntax inspired by `make`:\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casey/just/master/screenshot.png)\n\nYou can then run them with `just RECIPE`:\n\n```sh\n$ just test-all\ncc *.c -o main\n./test --all\nYay, all your tests passed!\n```\n\n`just` has a ton of useful features, and many improvements over `make`:\n\n- `just` is a command runner, not a build system, so it avoids much of [`make`'s complexity and idiosyncrasies](#what-are-the-idiosyncrasies-of-make-that-just-avoids). No need for `.PHONY` recipes!\n\n- Linux, MacOS, and Windows are supported with no additional dependencies. (Although if your system doesn't have an `sh`, you'll need to [choose a different shell](#shell).)\n\n- Errors are specific and informative, and syntax errors are reported along with their source context.\n\n- Recipes can accept [command line arguments](#recipe-parameters).\n\n- Wherever possible, errors are resolved statically. Unknown recipes and circular dependencies are reported before anything runs.\n\n- `just` [loads `.env` files](#dotenv-integration), making it easy to populate environment variables.\n\n- Recipes can be [listed from the command line](#listing-available-recipes).\n\n- Command line completion scripts are [available for most popular shells](#shell-completion-scripts).\n\n- Recipes can be written in [arbitrary languages](#writing-recipes-in-other-languages), like Python or NodeJS.\n\n- `just` can be invoked from any subdirectory, not just the directory that contains the `justfile`.\n\n- And [much more](https://just.systems/man/en/)!", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/just/1.25.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/just/1.25.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "just", "displayName": "just (Install)", "summary": "Just a command runner", "version": "1.25.2", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/michidk/choco/3fd7bbd83f1326ea3b38d7b03fe345419718e468/icons/just.png", "author": "The just team", "downloadCount": 5957, "tags": ["just", "justfile", "command", "runner"]}
