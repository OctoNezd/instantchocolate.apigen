{"description": "**NOTE:** This package has been deprecated in favour of the ffdshow package\n\nffdshow tryouts is a DirectShow and Video for Windows codec with support for a wide range of audio and video formats, such as Xvid, DivX, and H.264. It includes a powerful filter set that can enhance the video quality \u2013 with filters for resizing, deinterlacing, and displaying subtitles \u2013 as well as audio quality through normalization, down-/upmixing, and resampling.\n\nffdshow + X = ffdshow tryouts\n\nThe ffdshow tryouts project is a fork of the original ffdshow project. This fork was created by a group of members at Doom9.org. The last modification to the source code of the original project was done back in May 2006. The ffdshow tryouts project has continued where the original project stopped: Numerous bugs have been fixed, lots of code (that ffdshow borrows from the FFmpeg and Libav projects) has been updated, new features have been added as well as support for new formats.\n\n### Note\n\nThis package always installs the 32-bit version, even on a 64-bit OS. If you want to install the 64-bit version on 64-bit systems, install [ffdshow](./ffdshow).", "updated": "2024-03-20T04:48:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ffdshow-x86_32/1.3.4531.20160211", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ffdshow-x86_32/1.3.4531.20160211", "licenseUrl": "http://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/wiki/credits", "packageName": "ffdshow-x86_32", "displayName": "[Deprecated] ffdshow tryouts (forced 32-bit)", "summary": "The all-in-one codec solution", "version": "1.3.4531.20160211", "icon": "http://cdn.rawgit.com/TomOne/chocolatey-packages/edba4a5849ff756e767cba86641bea97ff5721fe/icons/ffdshow.svg", "author": "http://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/wiki/credits", "downloadCount": 1798, "tags": ["ffdshow", "DirectShow", "codec", "video", "audio", "subtitles"]}
