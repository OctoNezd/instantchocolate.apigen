{"description": "This plug-in was created for personal usage stream from my HDHomeRun PRIME to Roku 3. This allows up to 3 TV streams to be viewed by 3 different clients simultaneously. Due to Plex limitations with live streams, I  wouldn't recommend buying a HDHomeRun device solely to run with Plex and this Plug In. This plug-in should work with DLNA-enabled HDHomeRun (PRIME, PLUS, DUAL Gen 4).\n\nHDHomeRun Compatibility\n\nCompatible with HDHomeRun that have DLNA or HTTP streaming capabilities.\nCompatible\nHDHomeRun PRIME (HDHR3-CC)\nHDHomeRun 4DC (HDHR3-4DC)\nHDHomeRun DUAL (Gen4)\nHDHomeRun CONNECT (HDHR4-2US/2DT)\nHDHomeRun PLUS/EXTEND (HDTC-2US)\nHDHomeRun EXTEND (HDTC-2US-M)\nNot Compatible\nHDHomeRun DUAL (HDHR3-US/EU/DT)\nHDHomeRun DUAL (HDHR2-US/DT)\nHDHomeRun DUAL (HDHR-US/EU/DT)", "updated": "2024-03-15T04:04:07Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/hdhomerunviewer-plex/1.0.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/hdhomerunviewer-plex/1.0.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/zynine-/HDHRViewerV2.bundle/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "hdhomerunviewer-plex", "displayName": "HDHomeRun Viewer for Plex", "summary": "Watch Live TV on Plex using HDHomeRun, at home or remotely.", "version": "1.0.2", "icon": "", "author": "zynine", "downloadCount": 1748, "tags": ["hdhomerun", "viewer", "plex"]}
