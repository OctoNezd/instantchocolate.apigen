{"description": "NSQ is a realtime distributed messaging platform designed to operate at scale, handling billions of messages per day.\n\nIt promotes distributed and decentralized topologies without single points of failure, enabling fault tolerance and high availability coupled with a reliable message delivery guarantee. See features & guarantees.\n\nOperationally, NSQ is easy to configure and deploy (all parameters are specified on the command line and compiled binaries have no runtime dependencies). For maximum flexibility, it is agnostic to data format (messages can be JSON, MsgPack, Protocol Buffers, or anything else). Official Go and Python libraries are available out of the box (as well as many other client libraries) and, if you're interested in building your own, there's a protocol spec.", "updated": "2024-03-19T09:48:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/nsq/1.3.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/nsq/1.3.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/nsqio/nsq/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "nsq", "displayName": "NSQ", "summary": "A realtime distributed messaging platform", "version": "1.3.0", "icon": "https://nsq.io/static/img/nsq_blue.png", "author": "Matt Reiferson,  Jehiah Czebotar", "downloadCount": 1421, "tags": ["nsq", "realtime", "rt", "distributed", "messaging"]}
