{"description": "KeeOtp2 is a plugin for [KeePass](http://keepass.info). It provides a form to display one time passwords. The TOTP secret keys are stored in a normalized format, so this plugin is fully compatible with the built-in OTP function. It also can be used as a GUI for the built-in OTP function. *(The plugin can also migrate saved [KeeOtp(1)](https://github.com/tiuub/KeeOtpMirror) secrets, to the new built-in function.)*", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:03:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/keepass-plugin-keeotp2/1.5.9", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/keepass-plugin-keeotp2/1.5.9", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/tiuub/KeeOtp2/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "keepass-plugin-keeotp2", "displayName": "KeePass Plugin KeeOtp2", "summary": "Plugin for KeePass 2.x to display TOTPs (Time-based One-Time Passwords).", "version": "1.5.9", "icon": "", "author": "tiuub", "downloadCount": 4982, "tags": ["keepass", "plugin", "totp", "2fa", "keeotp2"]}
