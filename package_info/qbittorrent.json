{"description": "qBittorrent is a free software cross-platform BitTorrent client GUI written with Qt4.\nThe program uses libtorrent-rasterbar library for the torrent back-end (network communication) functionality.\nIt is developed by Christophe Dumez, from the University of Technology of Belfort-Montbeliard in France.\nIt was started in March 2006 and has been in active development ever since.\n\nqBittorrent aims to have a small foot-print, to be powerful, intuitive and visually attractive going beyond the\ncurrent functions widely provided by other applications. qBittorrent is an attempt to provide a \u00b5Torrent equivalent\nthat is open-source and multi-platform adding a streaming-like function to let users download-and-play video files.\nqBittorrent is currently offering functionality comparable to more popular BitTorrent clients such as Vuze but\nwithout requiring the Java Virtual Machine.\nqBittorrent requires Python only for the search engine while other clients such as Deluge and BitTornado require\nit for the BitTorrent protocol itself.\n\n## Features\n\n- Polished \u00b5Torrent-like User Interface\n- Well-integrated and extensible Search Engine\n- Simultaneous search in most famous BitTorrent search sites\n- Per-category-specific search requests (e.g. Books, Music, Movies)\n- All Bittorrent extensions\n- DHT, Peer Exchange, Full encryption, Magnet/BitComet URIs, ...\n- Remote control through a Web user interface\n- Nearly identical to the regular UI, all in Ajax\n- Advanced control over trackers, peers and torrents\n- Torrents queueing and prioritizing\n- Torrent content selection and prioritizing\n- UPnP / NAT-PMP port forwarding support\n- Available in ~41 languages (Unicode support)\n- Torrent creation tool\n- Advanced RSS support with download filters (inc. regex)\n- Bandwidth scheduler\n- IP Filtering (eMule and PeerGuardian compatible)\n- IPv6 compliant\n- Sequential downloading (aka \"Download in order\")\n- Available on most platforms: Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, OS/2, FreeBSD\n\n## Notes\n\n- This version includes the 64-bit version of qbittorrent, if you wish to continue using the 32-bit version you need to pass `--x86` when calling `choco install/update`\n- Beginning with v4.5.0, only 64-bit version is offered. If you have the 32-bit version installed, pin the version to 4.4.5 with command `choco pin add --name=\"'qbittorrent'\" --version=\"'4.4.5'\"`\n\n![qbittorrent screenshot](https://cdn.rawgit.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages/798547edb9c6cb22a4a58e08361da4450f0ab14c/automatic/qbittorrent/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/qbittorrent/4.6.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/qbittorrent/4.6.3", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "qbittorrent", "displayName": "qBittorrent", "summary": "qBittorrent is a free software cross-platform BitTorrent client GUI written with Qt4.", "version": "4.6.3", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages@edba4a5849ff756e767cba86641bea97ff5721fe/icons/qbittorrent.png", "author": "Christophe Dumez", "downloadCount": 977618, "tags": ["qbittorrent", "torrent", "sharing", "p2p", "foss", "cross-platform", "admin"]}
