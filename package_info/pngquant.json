{"description": "## pngquant\npngquant is a command-line conversion utility and library to quantize (lossy compression) and\ndither truecolor PNG images, especially those with a full alpha channel, down to 8-bit (or smaller)\nRGBA-palette PNGs. Such images are usually two to four times smaller than the full 32-bit versions, and\npartial transparency is preserved quite nicely. This makes pngquant especially useful both for Web sites\nand for PlayStation 2 development, where one of the texture formats is RGBA-palette-based (though not\nPNG-compressed). This is the same technique used for many of the images on the Miscellaneous Transparent\nPNGs page (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngs-img.html), and the results are often indistinguishable from\nthe original, truecolor PNG images.\n\n### Package-specific issue\nIf this package isn't up-to-date for some days, [Create an issue](https://github.com/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages/issues/new/choose)\n\nSupport the package maintainer and [![Patreon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@d15c4e19c709e7148588d4523ffc6dd3cd3c7e5e/icons/patreon.png)](https://www.patreon.com/tunisiano)", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:18:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pngquant/3.0.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pngquant/3.0.3", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/pornel/pngquant/blob/master/COPYRIGHT", "packageName": "pngquant", "displayName": "pngquant", "summary": "Lossy PNG compressor", "version": "3.0.3", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@cea86a9e25c293ccdea98beddf7e15d3ce40c682/icons/pngquant.png", "author": "Kornel Lesi\u0144ski", "downloadCount": 19919, "tags": ["png", "compress", "cli"]}
