{"description": "http-ping is a small, free, easy-to-use Windows command line utility that probes a given URL and displays relevant statistics. It is similar to the popular ping utility, but works over HTTP/S instead of ICMP, and with a URL instead of a computer name/IP address. http-ping supports IPv6 addresses.  For each request, http-ping displays:\n\t\n\t- The HTTP return code (and its brief textual description)\n\t- The number of bytes returned by the server (excluding headers)\n\t- The time taken to complete the request (i.e. round-trip time)", "updated": "2024-03-22T08:33:40Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/http-ping/10.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/http-ping/10.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.coretechnologies.com/company/Core-Technologies-Consulting_Freeware-License-Agreement.pdf", "packageName": "http-ping", "displayName": "http-ping (Install)", "summary": "http-ping is a small, free, easy-to-use Windows command line utility that probes a given URL and displays relevant statistics.", "version": "10.0", "icon": "", "author": "CORE TECHNOLOGIES CONSULTING,  LLC", "downloadCount": 651, "tags": ["http-ping"]}
