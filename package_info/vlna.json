{"description": "# vlna\nProgram vlna adds ties (Czech vlna or vlnka) after nonsyllabic prepositions (instead of spaces) in the TeX source files. This prevents line breaks at undesirable spaces.\n\n## Preface\nThere exists a special Czech and Slovak typographical rule: you cannot leave the non-syllabic preposition on the end of one line and continue writing text on next line. For example, you cannot write down the text \"v lese\" (in a forest) like \"v[new-line]lese\". The program vlna adds the ASCII tilde between such preposition and the next word and removes the space(s) in this place. It means the program converts \"v lese\" to \"v~lese\". You can use this program as a preprocessor before TeXing. Moreover, you can set another sequence to store instead ASCII tilde (see the -x option).", "updated": "2024-03-20T22:18:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vlna/1.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vlna/1.2", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "vlna", "displayName": "vlna", "summary": "Adds ties after nonsyllabic prepositions (instead of spaces) in the TeX source files.
