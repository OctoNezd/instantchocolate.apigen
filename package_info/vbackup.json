{"description": "## Disclaimer\n**VBackup** should run on most Windows operating systems, although it has only tried on Windows 7, XP and Vista.\n\n## Overview\n**VBackup** is a command line program for Windows that is used to make backup copies of directories.\nIt is similar in functionality to [XCOPY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCOPY) and [ROBOCOPY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy), however, **VBackup** implements file versioning. This means that you can not only restore files from the *latest* backup, but you can also restore them from *any previous* backup.\n\nI wrote **VBackup** for my *personal* use. It has several limitations, but it does everything that I need. I am releasing it as *freeware* (free for both private and commercial use) in case others will also find it useful.\n\n[The source code is available at GitHub](https://github.com/cprineas/VBackup) as a Visual Studio C++ project.\n\nPlease visit the *VBackup section* of the [FileViewer Support Forum](http://www.fileviewer.com/forum) for further information.\n\n## Usage\n**VBackup** must be run from a Command Prompt. Run `VBackup -?` for an explanation of all the command line option.", "updated": "2024-03-19T08:48:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vbackup/0.8", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vbackup/0.8", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cprineas/VBackup/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "vbackup", "displayName": "VBackup - Command Line Backup with File Versioning", "summary": "VBackup is a command line program for Windows that is used to make backup copies of directories.", "version": "0.8", "icon": "", "author": "Charles Prineas", "downloadCount": 451, "tags": ["vbackup", "backup", "version", "xcopy", "robocopy"]}
