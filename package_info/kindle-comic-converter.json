{"description": "\ufeff**NOTE:** The following text is for the most part an excerpt from the official [README.md](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/blob/master/README.md).\n\n# Kindle Comic Converter\nKindle Comic Converter (KCC) is a Python app to convert comic/manga files to EPUB, Panel View MOBI or E-Ink optimized CBZ. It was initially developed for Kindle but since version 4.6 outputs valid EPUB 3.0 so despite its name, KCC is actually a comic/manga to EPUB converter that every e-reader owner can happily use. It can also optionally optimize images by applying a number of transformations.\n\n## Warning\nKCC is not Amazon's Kindle Comic Creator (AKKC) nor is it in any way endorsed by Amazon. Amazon's tool is for comic publishers and involves a lot of manual effort, while KCC is for comic/manga readers. AKKC in no way is a replacement for KCC so you can be quite confident that the development will carry on.\n\n## Input formats\nKCC can understand and convert from, at the moment, the following input types:\n* Folders containing: PNG, JPG, GIF or WebP files\n* CB7, 7Z\n* CBR, RAR\n* CBZ, ZIP\n* PDF (only extracting JPG images)\n\n## Output formats\n* CBZ\n* EPUB\n* MOBI/AZW3 (see [MOBI support](#mobi-support))\n\n## MOBI support\nSupport for MOBI files is provided by [kindlegen](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/kindlegen) dependency.\n\n## Installation Parameters\n* `/AddToStartMenu:` - adds Kindle Comic Converter shortcut to Start menu (for all users or for the current user only)\n    - Supported values: `allusers`, `curruser`, `no`\n    - Default value: `allusers`\n\n### Examples\n* Install and add a shortcut to Start Menu for all users\n    ```\n    choco install kindle-comic-converter\n    ```\n* Install and add a shortcut to Start Menu for the current user only\n    ```\n    choco install kindle-comic-converter --params \"/AddToStartMenu:curruser\"\n    ```\n* Install and do not add any shortcut to Start Menu\n    ```\n    choco install kindle-comic-converter --params \"/AddToStartMenu:no\"\n    ```", "updated": "2024-03-23T11:03:37Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/kindle-comic-converter/5.6.5", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/kindle-comic-converter/5.6.5", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/blob/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "kindle-comic-converter", "displayName": "Kindle Comic Converter", "summary": "App to convert comic/manga files to EPUB, Panel View MOBI or E-Ink optimized CBZ.", "version": "5.6.5", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jakublevy/chocopkgs/icons/KCC.png", "author": "Ciro Mattia Gonano, Pawe\u0142 Jastrz\u0119bski", "downloadCount": 1480, "tags": ["kindle", "ebook", "manga", "convert", "cbz", "epub", "mobi", "kindlegen"]}
