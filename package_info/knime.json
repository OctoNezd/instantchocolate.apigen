{"description": "## KNIME Analytics Platform\n\nKNIME Analytics Platform is the open source software for creating data science applications and services. Intuitive, open, and continuously integrating new developments, KNIME makes understanding data and designing data science workflows and reusable components accessible to everyone.\n\n### Build end to end data science workflows\n\n__Create visual workflows__ with an intuitive, drag and drop style graphical interface, without the need for coding.\n\n__Blend tools from different domains__ with KNIME native nodes in a single workflow, including scripting in R & Python, machine learning, or connectors to Apache Spark.\n\n__Choose from over 2000 modules (\"nodes\")__ to build your workflow. Model each step of your analysis, control the flow of data, and ensure your work is always current.\n\n__Get up and running quickly.__ Select one of the hundreds of publicly available example workflows, or use the integrated workflow coach to guide you through building your workflow.\n\n### Blend data from any source\n\n__Open and combine__ simple text formats (CSV, PDF, XLS, JSON, XML, etc), unstructured data types (images, documents, networks, molecules, etc), or time series data.\n\n__Connect__ to a host of databases and data warehouses to integrate data from Oracle, Microsoft SQL, Apache Hive, and more. Load Avro, Parquet, or ORC files from HDFS, S3, or Azure.\n\n__Access and retrieve__ data from sources such as Twitter, AWS S3, Google Sheets, and Azure.\n\n### Shape your data\n\n__Derive statistics__, including mean, quantiles, and standard deviation, or apply statistical tests to validate a hypothesis. Integrate dimension reduction, correlation analysis, and more into your workflows.\n\n__Aggregate, sort, filter, and join data__ either on your local machine, in-database, or in distributed big data environments.\n\n__Clean data through normalization__, data type conversion, and missing value handling. Detect out of range values with outlier and anomaly detection algorithms.\n\n__Extract and select features__ (or construct new ones) to prepare your dataset for machine learning. Manipulate text, apply formulas on numerical data, and apply rules to filter out or mark samples.\n\n### Leverage Machine Learning and AI\n\n__Build machine learning models__ for classification, regression, dimension reduction, or clustering, using advanced algorithms including deep learning, tree-based methods, and logistic regression.\n\n__Optimize model performance__ with hyperparameter optimization, boosting, bagging, stacking, or building complex ensembles.\n\n__Validate models__ by applying performance metrics including Accuracy, R\u00b2, AUC, and ROC. Perform cross validation to guarantee model stability.\n\n__Make predictions__ using validated models directly, or with industry leading PMML, including on Apache Spark.\n\n### Discover and share insights\n\n__Visualize data__ with classic (bar chart, scatter plot) as well as advanced charts (parallel coordinates, sunburst, network graph) and customize them to your needs.\n\n__Display summary statistics__ about columns in a KNIME table and filter out anything that\u2019s irrelevant.\n\n__Export reports__ as PDF, Powerpoint, or other formats for presenting results to stakeholders.\n\n__Store processed data__ or analytics results in many common file formats or databases.\n\n### Scale execution with demands\n\n__Build workflow prototypes__ to \u200bexplore various analysis approaches. Inspect and save intermediate results to ensure fast feedback and efficient discovery of new, creative solutions.\n\n__Scale workflow performance__ through in-memory streaming and multi threaded data processing.\n\n__Exercise the power__ \u200bof in-database processing or distributed computing on Apache Spark to further increase computation performance.\n\n### KNIME License Terms and Conditions\n\nPlease see the [GPL v3, and the Additional Permissions according to Sec. 7](http://www.knime.org/downloads/full-license)", "updated": "2024-03-23T13:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/knime/4.6.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/knime/4.6.0", "licenseUrl": "http://www.knime.org/downloads/full-license", "packageName": "knime", "displayName": "KNIME", "summary": "KNIME\u00ae Analytics Platform is the leading open solution for data-driven innovation, helping you discover the potential hidden in your data, mine for fresh insights, or predict new futures.", "version": "4.6.0", "icon": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5486329", "author": "KNIME.COM AG", "downloadCount": 16108, "tags": ["knime", "data", "analysis", "analytics", "statistics", "data-mining", "admin"]}
