{"description": "TidalCycles (or Tidal for short) is a language for live coding patterns.\n    It allows you to make musical patterns with text, describing sequences and ways of \n    transforming and combining them, exploring complex interactions between simple parts.\n\n    Tidal allows you to express music with very flexible timing, providing a little language \n    for describing patterns as step sequences (which can be polyphonic and polymetric), \n    some generators of continuous patterns (e.g. sinewaves, sawtooths) and a wide range \n    of pattern transformations.\n\n    Tidal is highly composable in that pattern transformations can be easily combined together, \n    allowing you to quickly create complex patterns from simple ingredients.\n\n    Tidal does not make sound itself, but is designed for use with the SuperDirt synth, \n    and can control other synths over Open Sound Control or MIDI.", "updated": "2024-03-23T03:03:34Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/TidalCycles/1.9.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/TidalCycles/1.9.4", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/blob/main/LICENSE", "packageName": "TidalCycles", "displayName": "TidalCycles for Windows", "summary": "TidalCycles install for Windows.", "version": "1.9.4", "icon": "https://tidalcycles.org/img/tidal.png", "author": "Alex McLean", "downloadCount": 12409, "tags": ["tidal", "tidalcycles", "livecoding", "audio"]}
