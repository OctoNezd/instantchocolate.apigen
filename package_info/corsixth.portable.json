{"description": "CorsixTH aims to re-implement the game engine of Theme Hospital, and be able to load the original game data files. This means that you will need a purchased copy of Theme Hospital, or a copy of the demo, in order to use CorsixTH. After most of the original engine has been re-implemented in open source code, the project will serve as a base from which extensions and improvements to the original game can be made.\n\n## Notes\nTo play CorsixTH, you will need either the [Demo](http://th.corsix.org/Demo.zip), or the full game of Theme Hospital, available for example at [gog.com](https://www.gog.com/game/theme_hospital).\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/corsixth.portable/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-21T11:03:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/corsixth.portable/0.67", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/corsixth.portable/0.67", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "corsixth.portable", "displayName": "CorsixTH (Portable)", "summary": "A reimplementation of the 1997 Bullfrog business sim Theme Hospital.
