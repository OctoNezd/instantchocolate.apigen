{"description": "GStreamer is a pipeline-based multimedia framework that links together a wide variety of media processing systems to complete complex workflows. The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.\n\nApplications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface.\n\nGStreamer is free and open-source software subject to the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).\n\nVersioning is done in the `MAJOR.MINOR.MICRO` format with even `MINOR` numbers indicating stable releases, and odd `MINOR` numbers indicating unstable development releases [[source](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-docs/blob/master/markdown/frequently-asked-questions/developing.md#what-kind-of-versioning-scheme-does-gstreamer-use)].\n\nThis package performs a \"Complete\" install and may contain restricted codecs or protocols with additional licensing restrictions or potential patent issues in some countries.", "updated": "2024-03-16T15:03:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gstreamer-mingw/1.22.8", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/gstreamer-mingw/1.22.8", "licenseUrl": "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "gstreamer-mingw", "displayName": "GStreamer MinGW", "summary": "A pipeline-based multimedia framework for recording, streaming, and editing.", "version": "1.22.8", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/jmcker/ChocolateyPackages/98fb4efbad601990e352cd555261bb825ffb35ae/icons/gstreamer.png", "author": "GStreamer Team", "downloadCount": 1188, "tags": ["audio", "video", "recording", "streaming", "codec"]}
