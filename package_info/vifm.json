{"description": "Vifm is a curses based vi[m] like file manager extended with some useful ideas from mutt. If you use vi[m], vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your files without having to learn a new set of commands. It goes not just about vi[m] like keybindings, but also about modes, options, registers, commands and other things you might already like in vi[m].\n\nJust like vi[m], vifm tries to adhere to the Unix philosophy. So instead of working solutions which are set in stone user is provided with a set of means for customization of vifm to one's likings. Though builtin functionality should be enough for most of use cases.", "updated": "2024-03-23T13:33:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vifm/0.11", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vifm/0.11", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/vifm/vifm/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "vifm", "displayName": "vifm", "summary": "Vifm is a curses based vi[m] like file manager extended with some useful ideas from mutt.", "version": "0.11", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/vifm/vifm/2a7a101/data/graphics/vifm.png", "author": "vifm developers", "downloadCount": 6903, "tags": ["vifm", "file", "manager", "vim", "vi"]}
