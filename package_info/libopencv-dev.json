{"description": "OpenCV development defaults package.\n\n## Package info\n- The purpose of this package is to be more or less the equivalent of https://packages.ubuntu.com/noble/libopencv-dev. The MinGW/GCC version is chosen as the current one available on GitHub Actions hosted runners. Note that the existing https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/OpenCV official package does not provide binaries for MinGW/GCC.\n\n## Quick start\n- After [installing Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install), run `choco install -y libopencv-dev cmake.install --installargs 'ADD_CMAKE_TO_PATH=System'` in PowerShell, reboot and then get the folder from https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/lebars/Share/ImageOpenCV454_Ubuntu22.04.zip and inside, try `cmake -G \"MinGW Makefiles\" .`, then `cmake --build .`, then `.\\ImageOpenCV.exe` in a new PowerShell window and check that an image appears in a window.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n- Check that all the packages and their dependencies were installed, if one failed (e.g. due to network-related errors) try to reinstall it using `--force` or try a previous version...\n\n## Package parameters\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n- `/url:URL` - Will install the specified self-extracting OpenCV package, see e.g. versions from https://github.com/lebarsfa/Packages/releases (the Windows `PATH` might need to be updated manually with e.g. `C:\\OpenCV4.9.0\\x86\\vc15\\bin`, you might need to set manually CMake variables `OpenCV_ARCH` e.g. to `x86`, `OpenCV_RUNTIME` e.g. to `vc15`, `OpenCV_STATIC` e.g. to `ON`, rename folders e.g. from `C:\\OpenCV4.9.0\\x86\\mingw` to `C:\\OpenCV4.9.0\\x86\\mingw7`, etc.). By default, only the MinGW libraries compatible with the corresponding MinGW Chocolatey package dependency are installed. Use the standard parameter `choco install --ignore-dependencies ...` to avoid installing MinGW Chocolatey package dependency if needed.\n- `/checksum:SHA256` - SHA256 checksum of the self-extracting OpenCV package specified by the `/url` parameter.\n- `/urlX:URL` - Same as above, with X in [1,99], except this will not disable the installation of the MinGW libraries compatible with the corresponding MinGW Chocolatey package dependency.\n- `/checksumX:SHA256` - SHA256 checksum of the self-extracting OpenCV package specified by the `/urlX` parameter.\n- `/InstallDir:INSTALLDIR` - Installation directory.\n- `/NoPath` - Will not try to update Windows `PATH`.\n- `/NoRegistry` - Will not try to update Windows registry.\n- `/32and64` - Will install both 32 and 64 bit versions of the default MinGW libraries.\nTo pass package parameters, use `--params \"''\"` (e.g. `choco install libopencv-dev --params \"'/NoPath /32and64'\"`), and to install multiple self-extracting OpenCV packages together (if they are not mutually exclusive due to other reasons), try e.g.\n```\nchoco install -y chocolatey-core.extension\nchoco install -y --ignore-dependencies libopencv-dev --params \"'/url:https://github.com/lebarsfa/Packages/releases/download/libopencv-dev.4.9.0.20240121/libopencv-dev.4.9.0_x64_vc17_staticlib_Debug.exe /url1:https://github.com/lebarsfa/Packages/releases/download/libopencv-dev.4.9.0.20240121/libopencv-dev.4.9.0_x64_vc17_lib_Debug.exe /url2:https://github.com/lebarsfa/Packages/releases/download/libopencv-dev.4.9.0.20240121/libopencv-dev.4.9.0_x64_vc17_staticlib_Release.exe /url3:https://github.com/lebarsfa/Packages/releases/download/libopencv-dev.4.9.0.20240121/libopencv-dev.4.9.0_x64_vc17_lib_Release.exe'\"\n```", "updated": "2024-03-23T08:18:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/libopencv-dev/4.9.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/libopencv-dev/4.9.0", "licenseUrl": "https://opencv.org/license/", "packageName": "libopencv-dev", "displayName": "Development files for OpenCV", "summary": "Development files for OpenCV.", "version": "4.9.0", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/lebarsfa/Packages/a637a2f/choco/icons/opencv.png", "author": "OpenCV team", "downloadCount": 1043, "tags": ["OpenCV", "image", "processing", "programming", "library", "C++", "CPP"]}
