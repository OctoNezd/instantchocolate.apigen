{"description": "The Fusion LDV visualization system consists of two main programs, FUSION and LDV (LiDAR data viewer), implemented as Microsoft Windows applications coded in C++ using the Microsoft Foundation Classes. The primary FUSION display presents all project data using a 2D display typical of geographic information systems. It supports a variety of data types and formats but requires that all data be geo-referenced using the same projection system and units of measurement. LDV provides the 3D visualization environment, based on OpenGL, for the examination of spatially-explicit data subsets. \n    \n    LiDAR technology offers fast, real-time collection of 3-D points that are accurately geo-referenced.", "updated": "2024-03-21T11:48:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/fusion-ldv/4.40", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/fusion-ldv/4.40", "licenseUrl": "http://forsys.sefs.uw.edu/fusion/fusionlatest.html", "packageName": "fusion-ldv", "displayName": "Fusion LiDAR Data Viewing system", "summary": "A public domain LiDAR visualization system.", "version": "4.40", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages/master/Icons/fusion-ldv_icon.png", "author": "Bob McGaughey", "downloadCount": 3645, "tags": ["fusion", "LiDAR", "geographic", "GIS", "mapping", "public", "embedded"]}
