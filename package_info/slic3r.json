{"description": "Slic3r is the tool you need to convert a digital 3D model into printing instructions for your 3D printer. It cuts the model into horizontal slices (layers), generates toolpaths to fill them and calculates the amount of material to be extruded.\n\t\n\tWhen a newer versions of slic3r is released the previous versions are moved to a folder labeled \"old\". This package will attempt a second download from this location when the main download fails. This will allow packages that depend on this version to continue to work.", "updated": "2024-03-23T16:03:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/slic3r/1.3.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/slic3r/1.3.0", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html", "packageName": "slic3r", "displayName": "slic3r", "summary": "G-code generator for 3D printers", "version": "1.3.0", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/alexrj/Slic3r/master/var/Slic3r_128px.png", "author": "Alessandro Ranellucci", "downloadCount": 3791, "tags": ["3D", "Printing"]}
