{"description": "## How does it work ?\nTagFlow is a multiplatform application (compatible for Mac, Windows and Linux) that allows you to organize and find files on your computer through a system of smart tags. \n\n## Why using tags ?\nYou never know where to classify your documents, or what folder they are when you need them? You have documents copied to multiple storage and so many versions of the same file? All these problems are inherent in the system of classifications files that existed before the advent of computers !\n\nThe main problem with the files is that one can have only one access for each file: by browsing the folders until you reach the file. With tags, there is more order and it has several ways to get to the same file ! \n\n## Features\n* Intuitive search\n* Intelligent classification\n* Easy to use\n* No more duplicates\n* Versionning\n* Secure", "updated": "2024-03-19T05:33:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/tagflow/0.5.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/tagflow/0.5.1", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "tagflow", "displayName": "TagFlow", "summary": "TagFlow improves your classification and simplifies the search for your files using an intelligent system with tags.", "version": "0.5.1", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/TakataSanshiro/Chocolatey-Packages/8a7f7b72/icons/tagflow.png", "author": "TagFlow", "downloadCount": 788, "tags": ["admin", "file", "tag", "manager", "electron", "multi-platform"]}
