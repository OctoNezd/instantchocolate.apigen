{"description": "Heaven Benchmark is a GPU-intensive benchmark that hammers graphics cards to the limits. This powerful tool can be effectively used to determine the stability of a GPU under extremely stressful conditions, as well as check the cooling system's potential under maximum heat output.\n\nThe benchmark immerses a user into a magical steampunk world of shiny brass, wood and gears. Nested on flying islands, a tiny village with its cozy, sun-heated cobblestone streets, and a majestic dragon on the central square gives a true sense of adventure. An interactive experience with fly-by and walk-through modes allows for exploring all corners of this world powered by the cutting-edge UNIGINE Engine that leverages the most advanced capabilities of graphics APIs and turns this bench into a visual masterpiece.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- Extreme hardware stability testing\n- Accurate results due to 100% GPU-bound benchmarking\n- Support for DirectX 9, DirectX 11 and OpenGL 4.0\n- GPU temperature and clock monitoring\n- Comprehensive use of [adaptive hardware tessellation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkKtY2G3FbU)s\n- Dynamic sky with volumetric clouds and tweakable day-night cycle\n- Real-time global illumination and screen-space ambient occlusion\n- Support for stereo 3D and multi-monitor configurations\n- Cinematic and interactive fly/walk-through camera modes\n- Powered by UNIGINE 1 Engine\n\n## System Requirements\n\n- **Hardware**\n  - GPU\n    - ATI Radeon HD 4xxx and higher\n    - Intel HD 3000 and higher\n    - NVIDIA GeForce 8xxx and higher\n  - Video memory: 512 MB\n  - Disk space: 1 GB\n\n## NOTES\n\n- This is the free version of the Heaven Benchmark utility, payed edition will not be provided.", "updated": "2024-03-23T18:48:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/heaven-benchmark/4.0.0.20200922", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/heaven-benchmark/4.0.0.20200922", "licenseUrl": "https://benchmark.unigine.com/policies/privacy", "packageName": "heaven-benchmark", "displayName": "UNIGINE Heaven Benchmark", "summary": "Extreme performance and stability test for PC hardware: video card, power supply, cooling system.", "version": "4.0.0.20200922", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AdmiringWorm/chocolatey-packages@12f2fa1fd9b1705318dabdd379382e2af702f316/automatic/heaven-benchmark/icons/64x64.png", "author": "UNIGINE", "downloadCount": 6815, "tags": ["heaven", "cross-platform", "freeware", "benchmark", "unigine"]}
