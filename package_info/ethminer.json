Then hugely improved in Genoil's fork.\n\nNOTICE: Antivirus programs may detect and warn that this is a coin miner, which is correct since this is exactly an Ethereum miner. Antivirus programs issue such warning because some individuals install miner software on compromised computers to mine for them.
