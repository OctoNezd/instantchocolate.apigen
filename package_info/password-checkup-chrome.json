Please reset your password. If you use the same username and password for any other accounts, please reset your password there as well.\n\nPassword Checkup was built with privacy in mind. It never reports any identifying information about your accounts, passwords, or device. We do report anonymous information about the number of lookups that surface an unsafe credential, whether an alert leads to a password change, and the domain involved for improving site coverage. You can learn more about how Password Checkup works at https://support.google.com/accounts?p=password-checkup.\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/password-checkup-chrome/readme.md)**\n\t\n\n___\n**Click here to [Patreon-ize](https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3) the package maintainer.**\n___", "updated": "2024-03-20T17:33:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/password-checkup-chrome/1.10", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/password-checkup-chrome/1.10", "licenseUrl": "https://policies.google.com/terms", "packageName": "password-checkup-chrome", "displayName": "Password Checkup for Chrome", "summary": "Password Checkup helps you resecure accounts that were affected by data breaches.", "version": "1.10", "icon": "https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/password-checkup-chrome/password-checkup-chrome_icon.png", "author": "google.com", "downloadCount": 470, "tags": ["password", "checkup", "security", "breach", "utility", "chrome", "extension"]}
