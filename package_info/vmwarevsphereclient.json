When you log out of the vSphere Client, the client application retains the view that was displayed when it closed, and returns you to that view when you next log in.\n\nYou perform many management tasks from the Inventory view, which consists of a single window containing a menu bar, a navigation bar, a toolbar, a status bar, a panel section, and pop-up menus.\n\t\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/vmwarevsphereclient/vmwarevsphereclient_6.0.0.9103891/readme.md)**\t\n\t\n\n___\n**Click here to [Patreon-ize](https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3) the package maintainer.**\n___", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:18:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vmwarevsphereclient/6.0.0.9103891", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vmwarevsphereclient/6.0.0.9103891", "licenseUrl": "https://www.vmware.com/help/legal.html", "packageName": "vmwarevsphereclient", "displayName": "VMware vSphere Client", "summary": "VMware vShere Client - Manage virtual infrastructure", "version": "6.0.0.9103891", "icon": "https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/vmwarevsphereclient/vmwarevsphereclient_icon.png", "author": "VMware,  Inc.", "downloadCount": 75840, "tags": ["vmware", "vsphere", "client", "virtual", "machine", "virtualization", "esxi"]}
