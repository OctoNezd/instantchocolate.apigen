{"description": "## Wake Me On LAN\nThis utility allows you to easily turn on one or more computers remotely by sending \nWake-on-LAN (WOL) packet to the remote computers.\n\nWhen your computers are turned on,  WakeMeOnLan allows you to scan your network, and \ncollect the MAC addresses of all your computers, and save the computers list into a file.\n\nLater, when your computers are turned off or in standby mode, you can use the stored \ncomputers list to easily choose the computer you want to turn on, and then turn on all \nthese computers with a single click.\n\nWakeMeOnLan also allows you to turn on a computer from command-line, by specifying the \ncomputer name, IP address, or the MAC address of the remote network card.\n\n### Package-specific issue\nIf this package isn't up-to-date for some days, [Create an issue](https://github.com/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages/issues/new/choose)\n\nSupport the package maintainer and [![Patreon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@d15c4e19c709e7148588d4523ffc6dd3cd3c7e5e/icons/patreon.png)](https://www.patreon.com/tunisiano)", "updated": "2024-03-23T04:48:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/wakemeonlan/1.91", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/wakemeonlan/1.91", "licenseUrl": "http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wake_on_lan.html", "packageName": "wakemeonlan", "displayName": "WakeMeOnLan", "summary": "Turn on computers on your network with Wake-on-LAN packet", "version": "1.91", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@7cc8d197a0daa3297060d92a75902352d1cce156/icons/wakemeonlan.png", "author": "Nir Sofer", "downloadCount": 22893, "tags": ["wol", "network", "remote", "magic-packet", "cli"]}
