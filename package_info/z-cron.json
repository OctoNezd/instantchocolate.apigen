{"description": "**Automate your tasks with Z-Cron - The Task and Backup Scheduler**\nWith Z-Cron you can plan the execution of commands, programs or scripts, at particular times, so that recurring tasks on your PC are run automatically on schedule. Z-Cron is a central coordinating point for the scheduling or automation of software. Z-Cron can also be installed a system service. A system service is a program that starts automatically when Windows was booted, and runs in the background until Windows is shut down. With the Z-Cron scheduler you can have programs of all kinds started automatically by the system even if no user is logged in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for example nightly data backups with Z-DBackup.\n\n**Example tasks that can be scheduled with Z-Cron:**\n- Starting and stopping of applications (also with parameters).\n- Calling or saving of Websites.\n- Loading documents.\n- Starting, stopping and monitoring system services (professional version).\n- Copying, moving and deleting files and directories.\n- Cleanup of directories.\n- Archiving and compressing files and directories.\n- Switching computers in a network on or off.\n- Automated switching of electrical devices, e.g. with Z-USBswitch.\n- Establishing and disconnecting internet/VPN connections (Modem/ISDN).\n- Putting computers to standby mode and waking them up automatically.\n\n**These tasks can be started automatically at the following points in time:**\n- Daily (every x days).\n- Weekly (every x weeks at a weekday you can choose).\n- Monthly (at the x calendar day or the x weekday of a month).\n- Once.\n- After the system startup.\n- In regular intervals (e.g. every 5 minutes, every hour, etc.)\n\n**You can use Z-Cron scheduler in many different ways, for example:**\n- Regular data backup (for example with Z-DataDVD or Z-DATdump).\n- Automatic switching of electrical equipment or devices (for example with Z-USBswitch/Z-ParSwitch).\n- Automatic FTP data transfer (for example with Z-FTPcopyII).\n- Defragmentation and Scandisk\n- Virus scans\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/z-cron/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-23T05:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/z-cron/5.8.00", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/z-cron/5.8.00", "licenseUrl": "https://www.z-cron.com/use.html", "packageName": "z-cron", "displayName": "Z-Cron", "summary": "Cron-like scheduler for Windows", "version": "5.8.00", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/z-cron/z-cron.png", "author": "Andreas Baumann", "downloadCount": 1537, "tags": ["z-cron", "portable"]}
