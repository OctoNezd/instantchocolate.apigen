{"description": "**Package Dependency on Windows Server 2019** is a Chocolatey package for use as a dependency by package maintainers/creators. It is similar in concept to **[Chocolatey Fast Answers Extension](https://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey-fastanswers.extension)** to provide a (proposed) standard way for dealing with packages/programs that are OS version specific. This package will purposely fail (throw) when Windows Server 2019 is not found or an equal to or greater than version you specify.\n\nOther OS specific dependencies can be found [here](https://chocolatey.org/packages?q=tag%3Aosdependency).\n\n###EXAMPLE USE FOR MAINTAINERS/PACKAGERS:\n\n![Examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/dependency-server2019/dependency-server2019_examples.png)\n\nLook at [Version History](https://chocolatey.org/packages/dependency-server2019#versionhistory) for the builds you can specify as a minimum requirement for your package.\n\n###NOTE TO CHOCOLATEY MODERATORS:\n\nSeeing **dependency-server2019** listed as dependency on any package indicates the package has a requirement of Windows Server 2019. The package will fail automated testing because of this and require an exemption.\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/dependency-server2019/readme.md)**\n\n***\n**Click here to [Patreon-ize](https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3) the package maintainer.**\n***", "updated": "2024-03-09T08:18:24Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dependency-server2019/2019.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/dependency-server2019/2019.0", "licenseUrl": "https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Public_domain", "packageName": "dependency-server2019", "displayName": "Package Dependency on Windows Server 2019", "summary": "Package Dependency on Windows Server 2019 creates a way for package maintainers to build in OS version as a dependency.", "version": "2019.0", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/mylogos/myunofficialChocolateylogo_icon.png", "author": "Bill Curran", "downloadCount": 952, "tags": ["bcurran3", "dependency", "osdependency", "server2019"]}
