{"description": "## deluge\nDeluge is a [full-featured](https://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/About#Whataboutfeatures) \u200bBitTorrent client for Linux, OS X, Unix and Windows. \nDeluge uses \u200b[libtorrent](https://www.libtorrent.org/) in its backend and features multiple user-interfaces including: GTK+, web and console. \nIt has been designed using the client server model with a daemon process that handles all the bittorrent activity. \nThe Deluge daemon is able to run on headless machines with the user-interfaces being able to connect remotely from any platform.\n\nDeluge features a rich [plugin collection](https://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Plugins); in fact, most of Deluge's functionality is available in the form of plugins.\n\nDeluge was created with the intention of being lightweight and unobtrusive. \nIt is our belief that downloading shouldn't be the primary task on your computer and therefore shouldn't monopolize system resources.\n\nDeluge is not designed for any one desktop environment and will work just fine in GNOME, KDE, XFCE and others. We do our best to adhere to the [\u200bfreedesktop](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/) standards.\n\nDeluge is \u200bFree Software and is licensed under the \u200bGNU General Public License.\n\n### Package-specific issue\nIf this package isn't up-to-date for some days, [Create an issue](https://github.com/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages/issues/new/choose)\n\nSupport the package maintainer and [![Patreon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@d15c4e19c709e7148588d4523ffc6dd3cd3c7e5e/icons/patreon.png)](https://www.patreon.com/tunisiano)", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/deluge/2.1.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/deluge/2.1.1", "licenseUrl": "https://git.deluge-torrent.org/deluge/tree/LICENSE", "packageName": "deluge", "displayName": "Deluge", "summary": "Full-featured, lightweight BitTorrent client", "version": "2.1.1", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@92c5d5b8ae1220b2d37d826754440269ae7056c9/icons/deluge.svg", "author": "Arvid Norberg, Andrew Resch, Damien Churchill, John Garland", "downloadCount": 49534, "tags": ["torrent", "p2p", "encryption", "python", "admin"]}
