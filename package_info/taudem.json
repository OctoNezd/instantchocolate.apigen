{"description": "TauDEM (Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation Models) is a suite of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) tools for the extraction and analysis of hydrologic information from topography as represented by a DEM. TauDEM provides the following capability:\n      * Development of hydrologically conditioned (pit removed) DEMs using the flooding approach\n      * Calculates flow paths (directions) and slopes\n      * Calculates contributing area using single and multiple flow direction methods\n      * Multiple methods for the delineation of stream networks including topographic form-based methods sensitive to spatially variable drainage density\n      * Objective methods for determination of the channel network delineation threshold based on stream drops\n      * Delineation of watersheds and subwatersheds draining to each stream segment and association between watershed and segment attributes for setting up hydrologic models\n      \n    See the project home page for more information.", "updated": "2024-03-03T18:33:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/taudem/5.3.7", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/taudem/5.3.7", "licenseUrl": "https://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/license.html", "packageName": "taudem", "displayName": "TauDEM Command Line Executibles", "summary": "TauDEM Command Line Executables for 32 or 64 bit Windows PC", "version": "5.3.7", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/realmiketalbot/ChocolateyPackages@latest/taudem/taudem-logo.png", "author": "David Tarboton Hydrology Research Group,  Utah State University", "downloadCount": 109, "tags": ["taudem", "tau", "dem", "gis", "raster", "digital", "elevation", "model"]}
