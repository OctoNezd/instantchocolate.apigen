{"description": "To the wonderful world of Slow Scan Television (SSTV). SSTV is a very fun and exciting mode to send and receive images using your computer, a keying circuit and your ham radio whether it's vhf or hf. Over the years sstv has grown in popularly and the software/hardware used to send and receive pictures with amateur radio has come a long ways as well. MMSSTV has many features not found in other sstv programs and the best part about MMSSTV is that it is free.", "updated": "2024-03-15T22:04:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/mmsstv/1.13.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/mmsstv/1.13.1", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html", "packageName": "mmsstv", "displayName": "MMSSTV", "summary": "Slow-Scan Television encoder/decoder", "version": "1.13.1", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/penguin359/chocolatey-packages/b0b8efad9dfd65d6d9ff3843744d492b15b722cb/icons/Mmsstv_Icon.png", "author": "Makoto Mori (JE3HHT)", "downloadCount": 23, "tags": ["mmsstv", "HAM", "amateur", "radio", "SSTV"]}
