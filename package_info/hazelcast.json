{"description": "Hazelcast is an open source in-memory data grid based on Java.\n\nIt supports forming a cluster using multiple nodes, distributing data evenly across all nodes. This allows for vertical scaling both in terms of available storage space and processing power.\n\nHazelcast is usually used for:\n- caching frequently accessed data in-memory\n- storing temporal data like web sessions\n- in-memory data processing and analytics\n- as a memcached alternative with a protocol compatible interface\n- cross-java virtual machine JVM communication and shared storage\n\nNote: this package does not include checksum verification, as the downloaded ZIP archive has a different checksum with each download.", "updated": "2024-03-11T04:33:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/hazelcast/3.5", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/hazelcast/3.5", "licenseUrl": "http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0", "packageName": "hazelcast", "displayName": "Hazelcast", "summary": "Open source in-memory data grid.", "version": "3.5", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/mputters/choco-packages/master/icons/hazelcast.png", "author": "Hazelcast", "downloadCount": 646, "tags": ["hazelcast"]}
