{"description": "Free/Libre Open Source Software binaries of [VS Code](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vscode).\n\nVSCodium is a community-driven, freely-licensed binary distribution of Microsoft's editor VS Code.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Thilas/chocolatey-packages@c6bc7188363aecd38726935a305d586a594b0525/vscodium/screenshot.png)\n\nVS Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).\n\n## Features\n\n* **Meet IntelliSense:** Go beyond syntax highlighting and autocomplete with IntelliSense, which provides smart completions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules.\n* **Print statement debugging is a thing of the past:** Debug code right from the editor. Launch or attach to your running apps and debug with break points, call stacks, and an interactive console.\n* **Git commands built-in:** Working with Git and other SCM providers has never been easier. Review diffs, stage files, and make commits right from the editor. Push and pull from any hosted SCM service.\n* **Extensible and customizable:** Want even more features? Install extensions to add new languages, themes, debuggers, and to connect to additional services. Extensions run in separate processes, ensuring they won't slow down your editor.
