{"description": "## Typora\n\nTypora gives you a seamless experience as both a reader and a writer. It removes the preview window, mode switcher, syntax symbols of markdown source code, and all other unnecessary distractions. Instead, it provides a real live preview feature to help you concentrate on the content itself.\n\n- Distractions Free\n- Seamless Live Preview\n- What You See Is What You Mean\n\n## Note\n\nTypora is **now payware**. It has a 15 day free trial period after which you must [purchase](https://store.typora.io/) it.\n\n## Maintainer's Note\n\nI produce and maintain Chocolatey packages in my spare time, for free. If you use my packages, and appreciate the time and effort I put into making and maintaining them, please consider [making a small donation](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jtcmedia).
