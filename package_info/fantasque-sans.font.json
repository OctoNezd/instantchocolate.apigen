{"description": "A programming font, designed with functionality in mind, and with some wibbly-wobbly handwriting-like fuzziness that makes it unassumingly cool.\n\nThe font includes a bold version, with the same metrics as the regular one. Both versions include the same ranges of characters : latin letters, some accented glyphs (quite a lot), some greek letters, some arrows.\n\n![Sample](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/belluzj/fantasque-sans@ff9be0c44e744c7916316653c21e03b800e5fb54/Specimen/Specimen.png)", "updated": "2024-03-17T18:48:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/fantasque-sans.font/1.8.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/fantasque-sans.font/1.8.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans/blob/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "fantasque-sans.font", "displayName": "Fantasque Sans Mono Font", "summary": "An unassumingly cool programming font", "version": "1.8.0", "icon": "", "author": "Jany Belluz", "downloadCount": 498, "tags": ["fantasque-sans", "font", "sans", "sanserif", "monospaced", "embedded"]}
