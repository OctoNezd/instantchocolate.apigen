{"description": "Integrating your on-premises directories with Azure AD makes your users more productive by providing a common identity for accessing both cloud and on-premises resources. With this integration users and organizations can take advantage of the following:\n\n* Organizations can provide users with a common hybrid identity across on-premises or cloud-based services leveraging Windows Server Active Directory and then connecting to Azure Active Directory.\n* Administrators can provide conditional access based on application resource, device and user identity, network location and multifactor authentication.\n* Users can leverage their common identity through accounts in Azure AD to Office 365, Intune, SaaS apps and third-party applications.\n* Developers can build applications that leverage the common identity model, integrating applications into Active Directory on-premises or Azure for cloud-based applications\n\n    Azure AD Connect makes this integration easy and simplifies the management of your on-premises and cloud identity infrastructure. To find information about the Azure AD Connect version release history , please refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-version-history. \n\n### Notes\n* This package always installs the latest version of Azure AD Connect, regardless of the version specified in the package.
