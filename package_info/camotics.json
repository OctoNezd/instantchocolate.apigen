{"description": "## Features\nWith CAMotics, you can simulate 3-axis [GCode](https://camotics.org/gcode.html) programs for [CNC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNC)s and visualize the results in 3D. CAMotics runs on Linux, OS-X or Windows. It's fast, easy to use and best of all [Open-Source](http://opensource.org/) and free.\n\nWith the power to simulate your CNC tool paths you will avoid dangerous and expensive mistakes. By looking at the built-in examples and using the [online documentation](https://camotics.org/manual.html) you'll be running your own simulations in no time. And, if you need more help, we'll be happy to answer your questions via the [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/camotics-users/boxsubscribe).\n\nWould you start cutting without measuring first? Then why would you run a CNC program with out simulating? CAMotics will save you time and money and open up a world of creative possibilities by allowing you to rapidly visualize and improve upon designs without wasting materials or breaking tools. If you find CAMotics useful, consider [donating some money](https://camotics.org/#donations), otherwise it's totally free so go ahead.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/camotics/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-18T03:03:39Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/camotics/1.2.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/camotics/1.2.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt", "packageName": "camotics", "displayName": "CAMotics", "summary": "With CAMotics, you can simulate 3-axis GCode programs for CNCs and visualize the results in 3D.", "version": "1.2.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/camotics/camotics.png", "author": "CAMotics Team", "downloadCount": 239, "tags": ["camotics", "simulate", "simulation", "computing", "3-axis", "GCode", "CNC", "3D"]}
