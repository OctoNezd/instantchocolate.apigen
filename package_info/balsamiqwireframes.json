{"description": "Balsamiq\u00ae Wireframes (formerly Balsamiq\u00ae Mockups) is the industry-leading rapid wireframing software. By combining the comfort and simplicity of paper sketching with the power of a digital tool, your work is easier to share, modify, and get honest feedback on. Wireframes look like sketches, so stakeholders won't get distracted by little details and can focus on what's important instead. Balsamiq\u00ae Wireframes is a commercial application with a fully functional 30 day trial for local files. Afterward, you'll need to buy a license to edit your work. Viewing BMPR files remains accessible even after the trial ends.", "updated": "2024-03-22T17:18:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/balsamiqwireframes/4.5.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/balsamiqwireframes/4.5.4", "licenseUrl": "https://balsamiq.com/legal/terms/eula/", "packageName": "balsamiqwireframes", "displayName": "Balsamiq\u00ae Wireframes for Desktop", "summary": "Balsamiq\u00ae Wireframes for Desktop - Quick and easy wireframing for everyone!", "version": "4.5.4", "icon": "https://balsamiq.com/assets/company/brandassets/smileyface-transparent-1080x1080.png", "author": "Balsamiq\u00ae Studios,  LLC", "downloadCount": 609, "tags": ["balsamiq", "wireframe", "mockup", "prototype", "sketch", "trial", "ux", "bmpr", "editor", "viewer"]}
