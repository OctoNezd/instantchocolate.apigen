The number of supported input formats is even bigger! Furthermore LameXP not only runs on Windows XP, but also on Windows 7, 8 and 10 as well as many other operating systems.\n\n## Notes\n\n- If your anti-virus program complains about the LameXP program file, it is because it has been \"packed\" by UPX.
