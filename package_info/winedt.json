{"description": "WinEdt is a powerful and versatile text editor for Windows, with a strong predisposition towards the creation of [La]TeX documents. Do not, however, mistake WinEdt itself for a TeX system!\n\nAs an editor WinEdt allows you to exploit its intuitive (customizable) predefined interface and graphic controls. If you are not too keen on the mouse interface, don't worry: WinEdt also offers the means to customize its keyboard interface, allowing you to use double keystroke shortcuts that can be associated with any menu item...\n\nWinEdt is by default configured to run as a front end for MiKTeX or TeX Live. However, it is quite straightforward to define a completely different set of accessories. By default, Options -> Configurations Menu already contains a few alternative configurations.\n\nWinEdt's Menu contains plenty of useful commands, and many are associated with Shortcuts. It is strongly recommended that you take your time and \"walk\" through the menu. If you don't know what is there you won't know how to use it. For example, it is easy to move a selected block of text left or right or insert or remove comments in front of selected lines. It also easy to toggle Upper/ Lower Case, etc... Default Edit menu contains items like this and most commonly used of them are associated with simple shortcuts.\n\n[Screenshots](http://www.winedt.com/snap.html)  \n[TeX FAQ](http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq)\n\n### Trial software ([nagscreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagware))\n\nWinEdt may be used for a __31 day__ trial period to evaluate the software. All features are available during the trial period. Once the trial period has elapsed, WinEdt will begin issuing warning messages reminding you that the registration is overdue. Such warnings will not cause any damage to your documents; however, they will likely prove rather annoying and distracting. If you are using WinEdt for serious work you are advised to [obtain a license](http://winedt.com/registration.html#tables) prior to the end of your trial period to avoid unwanted distractions.", "updated": "2024-03-20T16:18:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/winedt/10.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/winedt/10.3", "licenseUrl": "http://www.winedt.com/registration.html", "packageName": "winedt", "displayName": "WinEdt", "summary": "Powerful and versatile text editor with a strong predisposition towards the creation of LaTeX documents", "version": "10.3", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/d5d78fc17432924a78acf27a880cceec5b1982df/icons/winedt.png", "author": "Aleksander Simonic", "downloadCount": 6421, "tags": ["tex", "latex", "editor", "trial", "shareware", "nagscreen", "admin"]}
