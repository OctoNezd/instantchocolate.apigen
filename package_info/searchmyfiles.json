{"description": "SearchMyFiles is an alternative to the standard \"Search For Files And Folders\" module of Windows.\n\nIt allows you to easily search files in your system by wildcard, by last modified/created/last accessed time, by file attributes, by file content (text or binary search), and by the file size.\n\nSearchMyFiles allows you to make a very accurate search that cannot be done with Windows search. For Example: You can search all files created in the last 10 minutes with size between 500 and 700 bytes.\n\nAfter you made a search, you can select one or more files, and save the list into text/html/csv/xml file, or copy the list to the clipboard.", "updated": "2024-03-20T10:03:34Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/searchmyfiles/2.92", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/searchmyfiles/2.92", "licenseUrl": "http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/search_my_files.html", "packageName": "searchmyfiles", "displayName": "SearchMyFiles", "summary": "Alternative to Windows Search For Files + Duplicates Search", "version": "2.92", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/2697586f564894b3346352497da46f320a02e725/icons/searchmyfiles.png", "author": "Nir Sofer", "downloadCount": 12594, "tags": ["files", "folders", "wildcard", "duplicate"]}
