{"description": "All image viewers i've ever seen have something on screen other than the image they're displaying. I didn't like that, so, pViewer was born. And that's why everything in pViewer is done with the right click menu and keyboard shortcuts. I also didn't want to use two different viewers for viewing images and for reading comics, and that's why pViewer have a Manga/Comic mode.", "updated": "2024-03-22T17:18:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pViewer/1.3.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pViewer/1.3.1", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html", "packageName": "pViewer", "displayName": "pViewer", "summary": "pViewer, a small and fast image viewer.
