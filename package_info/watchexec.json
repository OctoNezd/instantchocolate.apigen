{"description": "# watchexec\n\nSoftware development often involves running the same commands over and over. Boring!\n\n`watchexec` is a **simple**, standalone tool that watches a path and runs a command whenever it detects modifications.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* Automatically run unit tests\n* Run linters/syntax checkers\n\n## Features\n\n* Simple invocation and use\n* Runs on OS X, Linux and Windows\n* Monitors current directory and all subdirectories for changes\n    * Uses most efficient event polling mechanism for your platform (except for [BSD](https://github.com/passcod/notify#todo))\n* Coalesces multiple filesystem events into one, for editors that use swap/backup files during saving\n* By default, uses `.gitignore` to determine which files to ignore notifications for\n* Support for watching files with a specific extension\n* Support for filtering/ignoring events based on [glob patterns](https://docs.rs/globset/*/globset/#syntax)\n* Launches child processes in a new process group\n* Sets the following environment variables in the child process:\n    * If a single file changed (depending on the event type):\n        * `$WATCHEXEC_CREATED_PATH`, the path of the file that was created\n        * `$WATCHEXEC_REMOVED_PATH`, the path of the file that was removed\n        * `$WATCHEXEC_RENAMED_PATH`, the path of the file that was renamed\n        * `$WATCHEXEC_WRITTEN_PATH`, the path of the file that was modified\n        * `$WATCHEXEC_META_CHANGED_PATH`, the path of the file whose metadata changed\n    * If multiple files changed:\n        * `$WATCHEXEC_COMMON_PATH`, the longest common path of all of the files that triggered a change\n* Optionally clears screen between executions\n* Optionally restarts the command with every modification (good for servers)\n* Does not require a language runtime\n\n## Anti-Features\n\n* Not tied to any particular language or ecosystem\n* Does not require a cryptic command line involving `xargs`\n\n*Please Note:* This is an automatically updated package.
