{"description": "Invoke-Build is a build and test automation tool which invokes tasks defined in PowerShell v2.0+ scripts. It is similar to psake but arguably easier to use and more powerful. It is complete, bug free, well covered by tests.\n\nIn addition to basic task processing the engine supports\n\n* Incremental tasks with effectively processed inputs and outputs.\n* Persistent builds which can be resumed after interruptions.\n* Parallel builds in separate workspaces with common stats.\n* Batch invocation of tests composed as tasks.\n* Ability to define new classes of tasks.\n\nInvoke-Build v3.0.1+ is cross-platform with PowerShell v6.\n\nInvoke-Build can be effectively used in VSCode and ISE.\n\nSeveral PowerShell Team projects use Invoke-Build.\n\n**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:48:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/invokebuild/5.11.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/invokebuild/5.11.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/nightroman/Invoke-Build/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "invokebuild", "displayName": "InvokeBuild (PowerShell Module)", "summary": "Invoke-Build is a build and test automation tool which invokes tasks defined in PowerShell v2.0+ scripts.", "version": "5.11.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pauby/ChocoPackages@499ec314/icons/invokebuild.png", "author": "Roman Kuzmin", "downloadCount": 8126, "tags": ["admin", "powershell", "module", "build", "test", "automation", "psake", "invoke-build", "invoke.build"]}
