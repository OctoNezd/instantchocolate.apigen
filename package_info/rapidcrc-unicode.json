{"description": "[RapidCRC](http://rapidcrc.sourceforge.net/ \"RapidCRC\") is an open source CRC/MD5/SHA hashing program. I've extended the current unicode support to allow writing of unicode .sfv/.md5/.sha1/.sha256/.sha512 files, which can be turned on/off through the settings page. Unicode sfv files are written as UTF-16LE with BOM or UTF-8 (with or without BOM), and RCRC now performs a codepage detection. I've also expanded the shell extension that was included in the sourcecode to enable all operations directly from the extension.\n\n**List of other new features:**\n\n- multithreaded hash calculations with asynchronous I/O\n- ed2k hash calculation\n- SHA hash calculation\n- job queueing\n- popup menu to copy the calculated hashes to the clipboard", "updated": "2024-03-22T15:03:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rapidcrc-unicode/0.3.16", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/rapidcrc-unicode/0.3.16", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "packageName": "rapidcrc-unicode", "displayName": "RapidCRC Unicode", "summary": "Windows tool to quickly create and verify hash checksums.", "version": "0.3.16", "icon": "http://cdn.rawgit.com/0-F/chocolatey-package/master/icons/rapidcrc-unicode.png", "author": "Sebastian Ewert", "downloadCount": 1689, "tags": ["rapidcrc", "hash", "md5", "sha1", "crc32", "checksum"]}
