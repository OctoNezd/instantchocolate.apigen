{"description": "Visual Studio Live Share Audio enhances the existing [Visual Studio Live Share](https://aka.ms/vsls) experience, by\nenabling you to quickly spin up an audio call directly from within Visual Studio Code, without needing to use a\nseparate tool or service. Participants within a Live Share session can automatically join the call, and chat amongst\neach other, without needing to first coordinate which voice communication tool to use. For certain use cases (e.g. online\ntraining/mentoring, hack-a-thons), this can dramatically help reduce the barriers for collaboration.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@53c9d779f0f73975196bcc6bac1b1718dcfe71a0/automatic/vscode-live-share-audio/screenshot.png)\n\n## Notes\n\n* This package requires Visual Studio Code 1.21.0 or newer.\n  You can install either the [vscode](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vscode) or [vscode-insiders](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vscode-insiders) package.\n* The extension will be installed in all editions of Visual Studio Code which can be found.\n* While this package installs a specific version of the extension, Visual Studio Code by default will update the extension to the latest version on startup if there's a newer version available on the marketplace.\n  See [Extension auto-update](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_extension-autoupdate) for instructions on how to disable auto-update.\n* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).\n  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-23T17:33:37Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vscode-live-share-audio/0.1.93", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vscode-live-share-audio/0.1.93", "licenseUrl": "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-audio/license", "packageName": "vscode-live-share-audio", "displayName": "Live Share Audio VSCode Extension", "summary": "Adds audio calling capabilities to Visual Studio Live Share", "version": "0.1.93", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@53c9d779f0f73975196bcc6bac1b1718dcfe71a0/icons/vscode-live-share-audio.png", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 570, "tags": ["live-share-audio", "collaboration", "audio", "call", "voice", "vscode", "microsoft"]}
