It covers the static data and database schemas. Users can commit, track, and roll back changes, view and resolve conflicts, and automate the database development tasks in both dedicated and shared work models.\n\nBy applying the Source Controls for SQL Server, you can add this functionality to SSMS and perform all the necessary tasks without leaving your favored IDE. The solution is compatible with all popular systems of version control, including Git (including GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps), SVN, TFVC, and other version controls. \n\nYou can test the functionality of this tool properly, as the free trial is available.", "updated": "2024-03-16T08:48:40Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dbforge-sql-sc/2.6.6", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/dbforge-sql-sc/2.6.6", "licenseUrl": "https://www.devart.com/using-website/eula.html", "packageName": "dbforge-sql-sc", "displayName": "dbForge Source Control for SQL Server", "summary": "Solution for version-controlling the database schemas and data", "version": "2.6.6", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/DevartSoftware/devart-chocolatey@master/ProductsPng/dbforge-sql-source-control.svg", "author": "Devart", "downloadCount": 1174, "tags": ["MSSQL", "Database", "SQL", "Tools", "SQLServer", "Source", "Version", "Control", "Git", "SVN", "TFVC", "TFS", "Mercurial", "Perforce"]}
