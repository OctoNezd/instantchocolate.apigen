{"description": "CCEnhancer is a small tool which adds support for over 1,000 new programs into the popular program CCleaner. The tool uses the winapp2.ini system built into CCleaner to easily add new rules and definitions for programs. The rules were sourced mainly from the Piriform Support Forum, with several sourced from other places around the internet. Directly download the winapp2.ini file [here](https://content.thewebatom.net/files/winapp2.ini).\n\n## Instructions\nThe actual file containing the definitions is not included with the program, but is instead downloaded by the program. Simply press \u2018Download Latest\u2019 and the tool will automatically download the most recent version of the definitions. If CCEnhancer cannot locate the CCleaner.exe file you can open a dialog box and select the page yourself.\n\n## Credits\n[Agent_xs](http://forum.piriform.com/index.php?showtopic=28269), [Winapp2.ini](http://forum.piriform.com/index.php?showtopic=32310) & TwistedMetal from Piriform Forums | [Piriform](http://piriform.com) for creating CCleaner to begin with | Microsoft for the .NET Framework | [Everaldo Coelho](http://www.everaldo.com) for the icon.\n\nWhen used correctly, you should see more programs appear in the CCleaner menu.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThe entries created by this tool are not supported by Piriform, the makers of CCleaner.
