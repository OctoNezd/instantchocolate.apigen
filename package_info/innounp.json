{"description": "Inno Setup is a popular program for making software installations. Unfortunately, there is no official unpacker - the only method of getting the files out of the self-extracting executable is to run it. One piece of software that addresses this issue is Sergei Wanin's InstallExplorer, a plug-in for the FAR Manager that unpacks several types of installations, including Inno Setup (IS). But since it is not updated in a timely fashion, and so does not support the latest IS most of the time, this program was born. The advantages over InstallExplorer are:\n\nInnounp is open source and based on IS source. Therefore, it is more likely to support future IS versions.\nIt recovers portions of the installation script (.iss file), including the registry changes and the compiled Innerfuse/RemObjects Pascal Script, if available.\nIf you want to report a bug, request a feature, or discuss anything else related to the program, please write to the forum.\n\n#### Package Parameters\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n * `/NOSTART` - Do not add a start menu shortcut\n * `/DESKTOP` - Add a desktop shortcut\n\nTo pass parameters, use `--params \"''\"` (e.g. `choco install packageID [other options] --params=\"'/ITEM:value /ITEM2:value2 /FLAG_BOOLEAN'\"`).\nTo have choco remember parameters on upgrade, be sure to set `choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`.", "updated": "2024-03-23T00:48:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/innounp/0.50", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/innounp/0.50", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "packageName": "innounp", "displayName": "Inno Setup Unpacker", "summary": "Unpacker for installations made by Inno Setup", "version": "0.50", "icon": "", "author": "2019 QuickeneR, Ariman", "downloadCount": 8091, "tags": ["InnoSetup", "extract", "installer", "unpacker"]}
