{"description": "FileAlyzer is a tool to analyze files \u2013 the name itself was initially just a typo of FileAnalyzer, but after a few days I decided to keep it. FileAlyzer allows a basic analysis of files (showing file properties and file contents in hex dump form) and is able to interpret common file contents like resources structures (like text, graphics, HTML, media and PE).\n\nUsing FileAlyzer is as simple as viewing the regular properties of a file \u2013 just right-click the file you want to analyze and choose Open in FileAlyzer.", "updated": "2024-03-09T17:48:48Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/filealyzer/2.0.5.57", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/filealyzer/2.0.5.57", "licenseUrl": "http://www.safer-networking.org/products/regalyzer", "packageName": "filealyzer", "displayName": "FileAlyzer", "summary": "Tool for basic file analysis", "version": "2.0.5.57", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/88048d301a4dcb3c6fca1c71166e7a84951ad36f/icons/filealyzer.png", "author": "Safer-Networking Ltd", "downloadCount": 1545, "tags": ["file", "properties", "hex-dump"]}
