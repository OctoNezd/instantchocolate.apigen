{"description": "AutoIt v3 is a freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting. It uses a combination of simulated keystrokes, mouse movement and window/control manipulation in order to automate tasks in a way not possible or reliable with other languages. AutoIt is also very small, self-contained and will run on all versions of Windows out-of-the-box.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/autoit.commandline/3.3.14.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/autoit.commandline/3.3.14.2", "licenseUrl": "http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/license.htm", "packageName": "autoit.commandline", "displayName": "AutoIT (commandline, portable)", "summary": "AutoIT \u2013 Automation and scripting language", "version": "3.3.14.2", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/ferventcoder/chocolatey-packages/02c21bebe5abb495a56747cbb9b4b5415c933fc0/icons/autoit.png", "author": "Jonathan Bennett,  AutoIt Team", "downloadCount": 64965, "tags": ["autoit", "install", "automation"]}
