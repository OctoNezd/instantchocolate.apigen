{"description": "Public domain software for processing and analyzing scientific images \u2013 a.k.a. ImageJ 1.x.\n\n## Features\n\n* Display, edit, analyze, process, save, and print 8-bit color and grayscale, 16-bit integer, and 32-bit\nfloating point images\n\n* Read many image file formats, including TIFF, PNG, GIF, JPEG, BMP, DICOM, and FITS, as well as raw formats\n\n* Supports image stacks, a series of images that share a single window, and it is multithreaded, so\ntime-consuming operations can be performed in parallel on multi-CPU hardware\n\n* Calculate area and pixel value statistics of user-defined selections and intensity-thresholded objects\n\n* Measure distances and angles\n\n* Create density histograms and line profile plots\n\n* Supports standard image processing functions such as logical and arithmetical operations between images,\ncontrast manipulation, convolution, Fourier analysis, sharpening, smoothing, edge detection, and median\nfiltering\n\n* Geometric transformations such as scaling, rotation, and flips\n\n* Supports any number of images simultaneously, limited only by available memory\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@3d96ff972ea781c5e7ddf915b56f74c7b4baf5a4/automatic/imagej/screenshot.png)\n\n## Package Parameters\n\nThe following package parameter can be set:\n\n* `/AddToDesktop`   - add a desktop shortcut for ImageJ.
