{"description": "These programs allow you to create Morse either from keyboard entries, or by using a TXT file such as created with Windows Notepad. You can also use the Mouse as a Morse Key, one even as a simple LBUG for repetitive Dots and Dashes. The speed and tone can also be changed and a variety of suitable instrumental sounds used with one version, including using the little single speaker in the Console. This new version 4 now includes the option to use the Farnsworth system of learning, or to include a small selected random delay to attempt to Humanise the timing.\n\n## Screenshots\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/manual/morsetest/screenshot-morsetest.png)\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/manual/morsetest/screenshot-morsecode.png)", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:33:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/morsetest/4.6", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/morsetest/4.6", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "morsetest", "displayName": "MorseTest", "summary": "MorseCode and MorseTest allow you to create Morse either from keyboard entries, or by using a TXT file such as created with Windows Notepad.", "version": "4.6", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/manual/morsetest/morsetest.png", "author": "Gordon Sweet", "downloadCount": 356, "tags": ["morsetest", "HAM", "radio", "amateur", "CW", "morse", "learn", "tutor"]}
