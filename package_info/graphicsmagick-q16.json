{"description": "GraphicsMagick is the swiss army knife of image processing. It provides a robust and efficient collection of tools and libraries which support reading, wri\nting, and manipulating an image in over 88 major formats including important formats like DPX, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PNM, and TIFF.\n\nImage processing is multi-threaded (see the [multi-thread benchmark](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/OpenMP.html) results) using OpenMP so that CPU-bound tasks scale linearly\n as processor cores are added. OpenMP support requires compilation with GCC 4.2 (or later), or use of any C compiler supporting at least the OpenMP 2.0 specification.\n\nGraphicsMagick is originally derived from ImageMagick 5.5.2 as of November 2002 but has been completely independent of the ImageMagick project since then.", "updated": "2024-03-11T16:03:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/graphicsmagick-q16/1.3.35", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/graphicsmagick-q16/1.3.35", "licenseUrl": "http://www.graphicsmagick.org/Copyright.html", "packageName": "graphicsmagick-q16", "displayName": "GraphicsMagick-Q16", "summary": "Swiss army knife of image processing", "version": "1.3.35", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/c6a683db00f02ebb520e0cb539e86124483dac27/icons/graphicsmagick.png", "author": "GraphicsMagick Group", "downloadCount": 674, "tags": ["image", "graphics", "magick", "convert", "openmp", "admin"]}
