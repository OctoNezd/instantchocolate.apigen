{"description": "Transwiz will pack your existing personal data and settings into a standard zip archive for easy transfer to another computer. The Wizard will then unpack the archive on the new computer and restore your user profile - automatically reconfiguring the profile as necessary for the new Operating System. The Wizard will also rename the new computer and join it to your domain as required.\n\nTranswiz can transfer profile data from Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10, and to machines running Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 10.
