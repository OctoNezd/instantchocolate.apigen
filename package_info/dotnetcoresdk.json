You can do the same for your app or service. \n    Managed runtimes make code easy to write and guarantee safe execution. .NET Core manages memory with a garbage collector, compiles your code with a JIT compiler or ahead of time with .NET Native.\n    You can create .NET Core apps that run on multiple OSes and CPUs. .NET Core runs on Windows. Ports are in progress for Linux, OS X and FreeBSD, as is integration with the LLVM compiler.\n    This package only supports x64 architecture.", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:33:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dotnetcoresdk/1.0.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/dotnetcoresdk/1.0.1", "licenseUrl": "http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/cc300389.aspx", "packageName": "dotnetcoresdk", "displayName": ".Net Core SDK", "summary": "The Microsoft .NET Core SDK.", "version": "1.0.1", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanjaysingh/dotnetcoresdk-chocolatey/master/dotnet.png", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 7066, "tags": ["dotnet", ".net", ".netcore", "dotnetcore", "SDK", "admin"]}
