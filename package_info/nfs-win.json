{"description": "NFS-Win is a port of Ronnie Sahlberg's fuse-nfs project to Windows. Under the hood it uses Cygwin for the POSIX environment and WinFsp for the FUSE functionality.\n\nNFS-Win requires the latest version of WinFsp to be installed; you can find it here: http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/download/. It does not require Cygwin to be installed, all the necessary files are included in the NFS-Win installer.", "updated": "2024-03-23T21:03:47Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/nfs-win/1.0.17083", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/nfs-win/1.0.17083", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/billziss-gh/nfs-win/blob/master/License.txt", "packageName": "nfs-win", "displayName": "nfs-win (Install)", "summary": "NFS-Win is a port of Ronnie Sahlberg's fuse-nfs project to Windows", "version": "1.0.17083", "icon": "", "author": "Bill Zissimopoulos", "downloadCount": 1230, "tags": ["nfs-win", "nfs", "fuse-nfs", "fuse", "fs", "vfs", "filesystem", "dokan", "admin"]}
