{"description": "OperaChromiumDriver is a WebDriver implementation derived from ChromeDriver (https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) and adapted by Opera (http://www.opera.com/) that enables programmatic automation of Chromium-based Opera products for desktop and Android platforms. It is a part of the Selenium (http://code.google.com/p/selenium) project.\n\nWebDriver is a general purpose library for automating web browsers. It can drive the browser, running various tests on your web pages, just as if a real user was navigating through them. It can emulate actions like clicking links, entering text and submitting forms, and reporting results back to you so you know that your website works as intended.\n\nOperaChromiumDriver end-user emulation ensures that your entire stack (HTML, scripts, styling, embedded resources and backend setup) is functioning correctly without tedious manual testing routines.\n\nOperaChromiumDriver can be used without extra setup on Chromium-based versions of Opera starting from version 26.\n\nFor driving Presto-based Opera browsers, refer to the OperaPrestoDriver (https://github.com/operasoftware/operaprestodriver) project.\n\noperadriver.exe file is located in <Get-ToolsLocation>/selenium directory.\n\n#### Package Parameters\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n* `/SkipShim` - informs that the shim file should not be generated\n\nTo pass parameters, use `--params \"''\"` (e.g. `choco install selenium-opera-driver [other options] --params=\"'/SkipShim'\"`).", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:03:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/selenium-opera-driver/83.0.4103.97", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/selenium-opera-driver/83.0.4103.97", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/operasoftware/operachromiumdriver/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "selenium-opera-driver", "displayName": "Selenium Opera Driver", "summary": "OperaChromiumDriver is a WebDriver implementation derived from ChromeDriver (https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) and adapted by Opera (http://www.opera.com/) that enables programmatic automation of Chromium-based Opera products for desktop and Android platforms.
