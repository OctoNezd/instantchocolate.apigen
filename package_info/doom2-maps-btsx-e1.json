{"description": "Back to Saturn X is a series of megawad/partial conversion projects for Doom II, designed to be compatible with DOOM2.EXE. Created by the Back to Saturn X Team, it features an exclusive texture set, original music, and a new palette and colormap.\n\nSong and album titles from Guided by Voices provide the title, episode names, and map names. Titles and song lyrics are incorporated into the text screens as well.\n\nThe first episode was originally released on December 10, 2012 for Doom's 19th birthday, featuring twenty regular levels, one secret level, and a recurring train station hub. An additional level was inserted in a later release on August 1, 2013. The first non-beta release was on February 27, 2017, and inserted another additional level. The episode received one of the 2013 Cacowards.\n\nThe second episode was released on 1 September, 2014, with another twenty-two levels, a secret level, four episode hubs and an ending screen. It received one of the 2014 Cacowards.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the first episode was added to the list of official add-ons for the 2019 re-release of Doom II. This curated version replaces all the Guided by Voices-derived level names and its title is reduced to the acronym \"BTSX Episode 1\". The title screen was changed accordingly, and jokingly expands the title to \"Better Texturing with Startan X\".", "updated": "2024-03-21T20:33:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/doom2-maps-btsx-e1/1.1.5", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/doom2-maps-btsx-e1/1.1.5", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "doom2-maps-btsx-e1", "displayName": "Back to Saturn X: Get Out Of My Stations", "summary": "doom2 megawad", "version": "1.1.5", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/img/doomwiki.org/w/images/c/c7/BTSXE1.jpg", "author": "BTSX Team", "downloadCount": 304, "tags": ["doom2-maps-btsx-e1", "doom2", "btsx", "e1", "megawad"]}
