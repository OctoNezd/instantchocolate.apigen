{"description": "SonarLint is a Visual Studio 2015 extension that provides on-the-fly feedback to developers on new bugs and quality issues injected into C# and VB.NET code. SonarLint for Visual Studio is based on and benefits from the .NET Compiler Platform (\"Roslyn\") and its code analysis API to provide a fully-integrated user experience in Visual Studio 2015. With version 2.0 you can now establish a connection to a SonarQube server and bind your Visual Studio solution to a SonarQube project. This operation automatically updates the rulesets of the solution and attaches the required Roslyn analyzers to the solution.\n\n\n## Features\n\n- On-the-fly feedback\n- Support C#, VB.Net, Javascript and C/C++.\n- Support for standalone analysis.\n- Support for connected mode for C# and VB.Net projects.\n- [Connected mode] Suppression of issues marked as False Positive or Won't Fix on SonarQube", "updated": "2024-03-05T18:33:34Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sonarlint-vs2015/4.38.0.36876", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/sonarlint-vs2015/4.38.0.36876", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/SonarSource-VisualStudio/sonarlint-visualstudio/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "sonarlint-vs2015", "displayName": "SonarLint for Visual Studio 2015", "summary": "SonarLint provides on-the-fly feedback to developers on new bugs and quality issues injected into C# and VB.Net code.
