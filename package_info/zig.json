{"description": "Zig is an open-source programming language designed for robustness, optimality, and clarity.\n\n- **Robust** - behavior is correct even for edge cases such as out of memory.\n- **Optimal** - write programs the best way they can behave and perform.\n- **Clear** - precisely communicate your intent to the compiler and other programmers. The language imposes a low overhead to reading code.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:18:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/zig/0.11.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/zig/0.11.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/0.11.0/LICENSE", "packageName": "zig", "displayName": "zig (Install)", "summary": "A programming language designed for robustness, optimality, and clarity.", "version": "0.11.0", "icon": "http://cdn.rawgit.com/euantorano/zig-chocolatey-package/master/icons/zig-logo.png", "author": "Zig contributors", "downloadCount": 24920, "tags": ["zig", "development"]}
