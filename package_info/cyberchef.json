{"description": "CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web app for carrying out all manner of \"cyber\" operations within a web browser. \nThese operations include simple encoding like XOR and Base64, more complex encryption like AES, DES and Blowfish, \ncreating binary and hexdumps, compression and decompression of data, calculating hashes and checksums, IPv6 and \nX.509 parsing, changing character encodings, and much more.\n\nThe tool is designed to enable both technical and non-technical analysts to manipulate data in complex ways without\nhaving to deal with complex tools or algorithms. It was conceived, designed, built and incrementally improved by an \nanalyst in their 10% innovation time over several years.", "updated": "2024-03-22T22:03:51Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/cyberchef/10.8.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/cyberchef/10.8.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "cyberchef", "displayName": "CyberChef", "summary": "The Cyber Swiss Army Knife - a web app for encryption, encoding, compression and data analysis", "version": "10.8.2", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/sustainablelobster/dfir-chocolatey-packages/d2fe004b45e875a6c4a73085d28f8ab61e3ce184/icons/cyberchef.png", "author": "GCHQ", "downloadCount": 1661, "tags": ["cyberchef", "decrypt", "decode", "encrypt", "encode"]}
