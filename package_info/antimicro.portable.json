{"description": "antimicro is a graphical program used to map keyboard keys and mouse controls to a gamepad. This program is useful for playing PC games using a gamepad that do not have any form of built-in gamepad support. However, you can use this program to control any desktop application with a gamepad.\n\t\tThis program is currently supported under various Linux distributions, Windows (Vista and later), and FreeBSD. At the time of writing this, antimicro works in Windows XP but, since Windows XP is no longer supported, running the program in Windows XP will not be officially supported.
