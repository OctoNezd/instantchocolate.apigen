{"description": "pngcheck verifies the integrity of PNG, JNG and MNG files (by checking the internal 32-bit CRCs and decompressing the image data); it can optionally dump almost all of the chunk-level information in the image in human-readable form. For example, it can be used to print the basic statistics about an image (dimensions, bit depth, etc.); to list the color and transparency info in its palette (assuming it has one); or to extract the embedded text annotations. This is a command-line program with batch capabilities.\n\n#### Executables\n\n`pngcheck.exe` - test PNG, JNG or MNG image files for corruption, and print size/type info.\n`pngsplit.exe` - break a PNG, MNG or JNG image into constituent chunks (numbered for easy reassembly)\n`png-fix-IDAT-windowsize.exe` - fix minor zlib-header breakage caused by libpng 1.2.6", "updated": "2024-03-20T23:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pngcheck/2.3.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pngcheck/2.3.0", "licenseUrl": "https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.php", "packageName": "pngcheck", "displayName": "pngcheck", "summary": "Test PNG, JNG or MNG image files for corruption, and print size/type info", "version": "2.3.0", "icon": "", "author": "Alexander Lehmann, Andreas Dilger, Greg Roelofs", "downloadCount": 1200, "tags": ["png", "mng", "libpng", "debug", "cli"]}
