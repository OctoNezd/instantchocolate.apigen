{"description": "## Zerobrane Studio\nLightweight IDE for your Lua needs\n\nZeroBrane Studio is a **lightweight Lua IDE** with code completion, syntax highlighting, live coding, code analyzer, and debugging support for Lua 5.1, [Lua 5.2], [Lua 5.3], [LuaJIT], and [other Lua engines].\n\n[Lua 5.2]: http://studio.zerobrane.com/doc-lua52-debugging\n[Lua 5.3]: http://studio.zerobrane.com/doc-lua53-debugging\n[LuaJIT]: http://studio.zerobrane.com/doc-luajit-debugging\n[other Lua engines]: http://studio.zerobrane.com/documentation#debugging\n\nIt is **simple and instantly usable** for beginners (as tested with middle and high school students with no programming experience), yet **[feature-rich] and extensible** for experienced developers. Unlike Eclipse and IntelliJ, it has a **small footprint** and is **completely customizable with Lua**. Unlike TextMate and Sublime Text, it includes a **remote debugger** and a **full IDE feature set**. Unlike Decoda, it runs on Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux and supports **on-device debugging**.\n\n[feature-rich]: http://studio.zerobrane.com/features\n\nZeroBrane Studio also provides several unique features: **live coding** for immediate feedback, **Markdown formatting** in comments for providing instructions with minimal context switching, and **integrated interactive materials** for those learning Lua or getting familiar with programming.\n\nFor those interested in **game and mobile development**, the IDE supports debugging for L\u00d6VE, Moai, Gideros, Marmalade Quick, Corona, and Cocos2d-x. It also supports general Lua debugging for Wireshark, GSL-shell, Adobe Lightroom, OpenResty, Lapis, Moonscript, home automation, and [more][more-debugging].\n\n[more-debugging]: http://studio.zerobrane.com/documentation#debugging\n\n## Feature highlights\n* Small, portable, open-source, and **cross-platform** ([Windows], [Mac OSX], and [Linux]);\n* **Auto-completion** for functions, keywords, and custom APIs;\n* **Interactive console** to test code snippets with local and remote execution;\n* [Live coding] with [Lua], [L\u00d6VE][love-lc], [Gideros][gideros-lc], [Moai][moai-lc], [Corona][corona-lc], GSL-Shell and other Lua engines;\n* **Integrated debugger** (with support for local and remote debugging), and **[more][more-features]**.\n\n[Windows]: http://studio.zerobrane.com/images/debugging.png\n[Mac OSX]: http://studio.zerobrane.com/images/autocomplete-osx.png\n[Linux]: http://studio.zerobrane.com/images/scratchpad-linux-mint.png\n[Live coding]: http://studio.zerobrane.com/documentation#live-coding\n[Lua]: http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/live-coding-in-lua-bret-victor-style\n[love-lc]: http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/live-coding-with-love\n[gideros-lc]: http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/gideros-live-coding-with-zerobrane-studio-ide\n[moai-lc]: http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/live-coding-with-moai-and-zerobrane-studio\n[corona-lc]: http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/debugging-and-live-coding-with-corona-sdk-applications-and-zerobrane-studio\n[more-features]: http://studio.zerobrane.com/features", "updated": "2024-03-21T11:18:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/zerobrane-studio/2.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/zerobrane-studio/2.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "zerobrane-studio", "displayName": "Zerobrane Studio", "summary": "Lightweight IDE for your Lua needs", "version": "2.0.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/TakataSanshiro/Chocolatey-Packages@master/automatic/zerobrane-studio/icon.png", "author": "Paul Kulchenko, ZeroBrane\u00ae LLC", "downloadCount": 2884, "tags": ["Lua", "IDE"]}
