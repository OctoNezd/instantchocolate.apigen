{"description": "Grails is an Open Source, full stack, web application framework for the JVM. It takes advantage of the Groovy programming language and convention over configuration to provide a productive and stream-lined development experience.\n      This package assumes that the Java JDK has already been installed and that the JAVA\\_HOME machine environment variable is pointing to installed JDK. I do not reference JDK Chocolatey package here to stay flexible.\n      The specific Grails version will be installed to folder defined by %chocolatey\\_bin\\_root% environment variable. After installing, this package will set the GRAILS\\_HOME environment variable and will add the GRAILS\\_HOME\\bin folder to the machine PATH.", "updated": "2024-03-20T19:48:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/Grails/5.2.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/Grails/5.2.4", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/grails/grails-core/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "Grails", "displayName": "Grails", "summary": "Grails is an Open Source, full stack, web application framework for the JVM.", "version": "5.2.4", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/Litee/chocolatey-packages/master/automatic/grails/grails-logo.jpg", "author": "Graeme Rocher", "downloadCount": 12283, "tags": ["Grails", "Groovy", "Java", "MVC", "web"]}
