{"description": "# Thorium\n\n## Chromium fork for linux named after [radioactive element No. 90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium). For Windows.\n\n#### Package Parameters\n    choco install thorium --params '\"/params\"'\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n * `/AVX` - for those of you who want to use the avx build\n * `/SSE3` - for those of you who want to use the sse3 build\n\n### if you want to use AVX2 build use installation as usual 'choco install thorium'\n\n- Always built with the latest stable version of [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/).\n- Intended to behave like and have the featureset of Google Chrome, with differences/patches/enhancements listed below.\n- Includes [Widevine](https://www.widevine.com/), [All Codecs](https://tools.woolyss.com/html5-audio-video-tester/), Chrome Plugins, as well as thinLTO, CFlag, LDFlag, LLVM Loop, and PGO compiler optimizations. It is built with [SSE4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4), [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions), and [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set), so it won't launch on CPU's below 2nd gen Core or AMD FX, but benefits from Advanced Vector EXtensions. If your CPU lacks AVX, you can use builds from the [Thorium SSE3](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-SSE3) repo.\n- For more info, read the [PATCHES.md](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/infra/PATCHES.md) file.\n- Known bugs are in the [BUGS.md](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/infra/BUGS.md) file.\n- A list of Chromium command line flags can be found at > https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:18:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/thorium/122.0.6261.132", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/thorium/122.0.6261.132", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "thorium", "displayName": "Thorium", "summary": "Chromium fork for Windows named after radioactive element No. 90", "version": "122.0.6261.132", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/Alex313031/thorium/8bb2c4123c70647c6f64ab221f330af1f3b2e3d9/logos/NEW/thorium.png", "author": "Alex313031", "downloadCount": 947, "tags": ["thorium", "chrome", "chromium", "admin", "webbrowser", "chromium-browser", "thorium-browser"]}
