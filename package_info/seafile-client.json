{"description": "Seafile is a next-generation open source cloud storage system with advanced support for file syncing, privacy protection and teamwork.\n\nCollections of files are called libraries, and each library can be synced separately. A library can be encrypted with a user chosen password.\nThis password is not stored on the server, so even the server admin cannot view a file's contents.\n\nSeafile allows users to create groups with file syncing, wiki, and discussion to enable easy collaboration around documents within a team.", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:18:48Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/seafile-client/9.0.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/seafile-client/9.0.4", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/haiwen/seafile-client/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "seafile-client", "displayName": "Seafile (Windows Client)", "summary": "File Syncing and Collaboration for Teams", "version": "9.0.4", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages@65cff22d071fb30b82b8f2bdee89211b541520c7/icons/seafile-client.png", "author": "Seafile Ltd.", "downloadCount": 71810, "tags": ["seafile-client", "seafile", "syncing", "sharing", "admin", "foss", "cross-platform"]}
