{"description": "The GnuWin project provides Win32-versions of GNU tools, or tools with a similar open source licence. The ports are native ports, that is they rely only on libraries provided with any standard 32-bits MS-Windows operating system. Unlike CygWin or Msys, native ports do not rely on some kind of Unix emulation, so that there is no need to install additional emulation libraries.\n        | Please install with chocolatey (http://nuget.org/List/Packages/chocolatey). This package can be installed multiple times. Only updated tools since the last install will be downloaded and installed.", "updated": "2024-03-23T12:18:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/GnuWin/0.6.3.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/GnuWin/0.6.3.1", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html", "packageName": "GnuWin", "displayName": "GnuWin", "summary": "The GnuWin project provides Win32-versions of GNU tools, or tools with a similar open source licence.", "version": "0.6.3.1", "icon": "http://a.fsdn.com/con/icons/gn/gnuwin32@sf.net/gnuwin.png", "author": "GnuWin32", "downloadCount": 17951, "tags": ["gnu", "tools", "linux", "chocolatey"]}
