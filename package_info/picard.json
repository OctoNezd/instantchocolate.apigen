{"description": "MusicBrainz Picard is a cross-platform (Linux/Mac OS X/Windows) application written in Python and is the official MusicBrainz tagger.\n\nPicard supports the majority of audio file formats, is capable of using audio fingerprints (AcoustIDs), performing CD lookups and disc ID submissions, and it has excellent Unicode support. Additionally, there are several plugins available that extend Picard's features.\n\nWhen tagging files, Picard uses an album-oriented approach. This approach allows it to utilize the MusicBrainz data as effectively as possible and correctly tag your music. For more information, see the illustrated quick start guide to tagging.\n\nPicard is named after Captain Jean-Luc Picard from the TV series Star Trek: The Next Generation.\n\n## Features\n- **Multiple Formats:** Picard supports all popular music formats, including MP3, FLAC, OGG, M4A, WMA, WAV, and more.\n- **AcoustID:** Picard uses [AcoustID](http://acoustid.org/) audio fingerprints, allowing files to be identified by the actual music, even if they have no metadata.\n- **CD Lookups:** Picard can lookup entire music CDs with a click.\n- **Plugin Support:** If you need a particular feature, you can choose from a selection of [available plugins](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/plugins/) or write your own.", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:03:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/picard/2.11.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/picard/2.11.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/metabrainz/picard/blob/master/COPYING.txt", "packageName": "picard", "displayName": "MusicBrainz Picard", "summary": "Official MusicBrainz audio tagger", "version": "2.11.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages@c0ad49fb5e8519b7bf9538ebe63ae95dbddec633/icons/picard.svg", "author": "MusicBrainz", "downloadCount": 67077, "tags": ["musicbrainz", "picard", "audio", "tagger", "music", "admin", "foss", "cross-platform"]}
