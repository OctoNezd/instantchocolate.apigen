{"description": "Unlock advanced features for the Wireless GO II with R\u00d8DE Central! This easy-to-use companion app lets you set up your device preferences, access, optimise and export recordings, activate and deactivate functions, and update your firmware. It's free to download for Mac and Windows.\n\n### More Features. More Flexibility\n\nConnecting your Wireless GO II to R\u00d8DE Central allows you to access a host of handy features, including a safety channel, which records a second track at -20dB in case your main audio clips, a mute lock so you never accidentally mute your transmitters, and a fine gain control which expands the three-stage pad to a 10-stage pad.\n\n### On-Board Recording\n\nEach Wireless GO II transmitter has on-board recording capabilities, with enough internal memory to store over 40 hours of compressed audio and seven hours of uncompressed audio. When active, recording will begin as soon as the transmitters are connected to the receiver, so you will always have a backup of your recording in case you experience dropouts or other audio issues.\n\nWhen you load your files in R\u00d8DE Central, you'll even be able to see exactly where any dropouts occurred, so you can pinpoint exactly what audio you need. Welcome to worry-free recording.\n\n### Firmware\n\nThis version of R\u00d8DE Central updates your Wireless GO II devices to firmware version v1.8.9\n\n### Package updates\n\nRode use a 'static' download URL such that when they release a new version it will break older Chocolatey packages. Currently this package needs to be manually updated as Rode also keep changing the layout of the .zip file for each release. \n\nIf you notice the package isn't working please leave a comment, or even better submit a pull request in the [package source repository](https://github.com/flcdrg/au-packages/tree/master/rode-central).", "updated": "2024-03-22T03:18:52Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rode-central/2.0.43", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/rode-central/2.0.43", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "rode-central", "displayName": "R\u00d8DE Central", "summary": "R\u00d8DE Central is a companion app for the Wireless GO II that allows you to set up device preferences, access, optimise and export recordings, activate and deactivate functions, and update your firmware", "version": "2.0.43", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/flcdrg/au-packages/e076acef472529595d9a5064abbd1d3c6b10e37c/rode-central/icons/rode-central.png", "author": "R\u00d8DE Microphones", "downloadCount": 1968, "tags": ["Wireless", "GO", "II", "R\u00d8DE", "Rode", "audio", "microphones"]}
