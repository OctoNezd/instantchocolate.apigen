{"description": "Markdown linting and style checking for Visual Studio Code.\n\nThe [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language is designed to be easy to read, write, and understand. It succeeds - and its flexibility is both a benefit and a drawback. Many styles are possible, so formatting can be inconsistent. Some constructs don't work well in all parsers and should be avoided. For example, [here are some common/troublesome Markdown constructs](https://gist.github.com/DavidAnson/006a6c2a2d9d7b21b025).\n\n[markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) is a Visual Studio Code extension that includes a library of rules to encourage standards and consistency for Markdown files. It is powered by [markdownlint for Node.js](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) which is based on [markdownlint for Ruby](https://github.com/mivok/markdownlint).\n\n## Notes\n\n* The package always installs the latest version of the extension.\n  The version of the Chocolatey package reflects not the version of the extension.", "updated": "2024-03-21T14:33:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vscode-markdownlint/1.0.0.20181011", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vscode-markdownlint/1.0.0.20181011", "licenseUrl": "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint/license", "packageName": "vscode-markdownlint", "displayName": "Visual Studio Code Markdownlint Extension", "summary": "Markdown linting and style checking for Visual Studio Code", "version": "1.0.0.20181011", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bbtsoftware/chocolatey-packages@4a055e434da1035a66c821c68869de8ea06bdd2f/icons/vscode-markdownlint.png", "author": "David Anson", "downloadCount": 5703, "tags": ["microsoft", "visualstudiocode", "vscode", "extension", "markdown", "markdownlint"]}
