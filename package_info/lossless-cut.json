{"description": "Simple and ultra fast cross platform tool for lossless trimming/cutting of video and audio files. Great for saving space by rough cutting your large video files taken from a video camera, GoPro, drone, etc. It lets you quickly extract the good parts from your videos and discard many gigabytes of data without doing a slow re-encode and thereby losing quality. It extremely fast because it does an almost direct data copy. It uses the awesome ffmpeg (included) for doing the grunt work.\n\n## Features\n- Lossless cutting of common video and audio formats\n- Lossless re-merge of selected segments (for cutting out commercials etc.)\n- Lossless merge of arbitrary files (with identical codecs)\n- Lossless extracting of all data streams from a file (video, audio, subtitle, ++)\n- Take full-resolution snapshots from videos in JPEG/PNG format\n- Manual input range of cutpoints\n- Can include more than 2 streams or remove audio track (optional)\n- Apply a timecode offset\n- Change rotation/orientation metadata in videos. Great for rotating phone videos that come out the wrong way without actually re-encoding the video.\n\n## Package Parameters\nCommand-line options for installer configuration:\n- `/InstallDir:PATH`\n- `/NoDesktopShortcut` Do not create Desktop Shortcut\n- `/NoStartMenuShortcut` Do not create Start Menu Shortcut\n- `/NoSendToShortcut` Do not create Send To Shortcut\n- `/DontRegisterApp` Do not register app\n\n### Examples\n- Portable mode:\n`choco install lossless-cut --params \"/InstallDir:C:\\your\\install\\path /NoDesktopShortcut /NoStartMenuShortcut /NoSendToShortcut /DontRegisterApp\"`\\\n\n### Default Parameters\nBy default, **installation** of this package:\n- Will be installed in Chocolatey tools directory.\n- Will install a Desktop shortcut.\n- Will install a Start Menu shortcut.\n- Will install a Sent To shortcut.\n\nTo have choco remember parameters on upgrade, be sure to set `choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/lossless-cut/screenshot.gif)", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:33:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/lossless-cut/3.59.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/lossless-cut/3.59.1", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mifi/lossless-cut/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "lossless-cut", "displayName": "LosslessCut", "summary": "Simple and ultra fast cross platform tool for lossless trimming/cutting of video and audio files.", "version": "3.59.1", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/lossless-cut/lossless-cut.png", "author": "Mikael Finstad", "downloadCount": 27308, "tags": ["lossless-cut", "lossless", "trimming", "cutting", "video", "audio", "files"]}
