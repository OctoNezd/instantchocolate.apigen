{"description": "# OfficeToPDF\n\n## Giving back to the community\n\n[Cognidox](https://www.cognidox.com/) would not exist without the help of many open source projects. Perl,\nApache and Solr are just a few of the excellent open source packages that help make CogniDox a leading document\nmanagement system. So, to show our appreciation, we've released a couple of open source projects such as\nOfficeToPDF to help others.\n\n---\n## OfficeToPDF - what does it do?\n\nOfficeToPDF is a **command line utility** that converts Microsoft Office 2003, 2007, 2010, 2013 and 2016\ndocuments from their native format into PDF using Office's in-built PDF export features.\n\nMost Office to PDF converter tools are intended as single-user desktop applications. OfficeToPDF is\nuseful (and unique) if you want to automatically create PDF files on a server-wide basis and free\nindividual users from an extra step of using the Save...\"\ncommand on their Office files. These PDF files can then be stored and managed on a separate server. \nThis can be useful if, for example, a department has a policy of only distributing PDF versions of \ndocuments to people outside the department.\n\nThere are some technical requirements that must be met before you can use it:</p>\n\n* .NET Framework 4\n* Office 2016, 2013, 2010 **or** Office 2007\n\nIf you are using Office 2007, you will also need:\n\n* Visual Studio 2010 Tools for Office Runtime [<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/download/details.aspx?id=48217\" target=\"_blank\">Download</a>]\n* 2007 Microsoft Office Add-in: Microsoft Save as PDF or XPS [<a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=4d951911-3e7e-4ae6-b059-a2e79ed87041&displaylang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Download</a>]\n\nIt is distributed under the [**Apache 2.0**](https://github.com/cognidox/OfficeToPDF/blob/master/LICENSE.md) license.\n\n---\n\n## Supported File Types\n\nThe following file types can be converted:\n\n* Word (.doc, .dot,&nbsp; .docx, .dotx, .docm, .dotm, .rtf, .wpd)\n* Excel&nbsp; (.xls, .xlsx, .xlsm, .xlsb, .xlt, .xltx, .xltm, .csv)\n* Powerpoint (.ppt, .pptx, .pptm, .pps, .ppsx, .ppsm, .pot, .potx, .potm)\n* Visio (.vsd, .vsdx, .vsdm, .svg) [Requires &gt;= Visio 2013 for .svg, .vsdx and .vsdm support]\n* Publisher (.pub) </li><li>Outlook (.msg, .vcf, .ics)\n* Project (.mpp) [Requires Project &gt;= 2010 for .mpp support]\n* OpenOffice (.odt, .odp, .ods)\n\nConversion of Visio, Publisher and Project&nbsp;files require that the Visio, Publisher and Project\napplications are installed. These are not included in the Office standard package.\n\n---\n\n## Instructions\n\nIn order to use the tool, download the officetopdf.exe file and, from the command line, run officetopdf.exe with two arguments - \nthe source Office document and the destination PDF document. e.g.\n\n    Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]\n    Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.
