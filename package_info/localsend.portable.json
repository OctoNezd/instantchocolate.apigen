{"description": "## LocalSend\n\nLocalSend is a cross-platform app that enables secure communication between devices using a REST API and HTTPS encryption. Unlike other messaging apps that rely on external servers, LocalSend doesn't require an internet connection or third-party servers, making it a fast and reliable solution for local communication.\n\nLocalSend uses a secure communication protocol that allows devices to communicate with each other using a REST API. All data is sent securely over HTTPS, and the TLS/SSL certificate is generated on the fly on each device, ensuring maximum security.\n\nFor more information on the LocalSend Protocol, see the [documentation](https://github.com/localsend/protocol).\n\n![LocalSend Screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/brogers5/chocolatey-package-localsend.portable@d0493af839be5c7d10d4df0a9fd807287f08e569/Screenshot.png)\n\n## Package Parameters\n\n* `/NoShim` - Opt out of creating a GUI shim.\n* `/NoDesktopShortcut` - Opt out of creating a Desktop shortcut.\n* `/NoProgramsShortcut` - Opt out of creating a Programs shortcut in your Start Menu.\n* `/Start` - Automatically start LocalSend after installation completes.\n\n## Package Notes\n\nFor future upgrade operations, consider opting into Chocolatey's `useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades` feature to avoid having to pass the same arguments with each upgrade:\n\n```shell\nchoco feature enable --name=\"'useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades'\"\n```", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:18:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/localsend.portable/1.14.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/localsend.portable/1.14.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/localsend/localsend/blob/v1.14.0/LICENSE", "packageName": "localsend.portable", "displayName": "LocalSend (Portable)", "summary": "An open source cross-platform alternative to AirDrop", "version": "1.14.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/brogers5/chocolatey-package-localsend.portable@d0493af839be5c7d10d4df0a9fd807287f08e569/localsend.portable.png", "author": "Tien Do Nam", "downloadCount": 6615, "tags": ["localsend", "message", "file", "transfer", "64-bit", "portable", "cross-platform", "foss"]}
