{"description": "Sobor is a stereo reverberation effect AU, AAX, and VST plugin for professional music production applications.  This reverb plugin provides a wide palette of reverb spaces while requiring only a minimal effort to obtain useful results.  The tails created by this reverb are very dense and produce a well-defined spatialization.  Since the reverb uses a kind of \u201ctrue-stereo\u201d algorithm the panned sounds receive a good stereo field placement.  We believe Sobor provides one of the lushest and widest reverb tails available on the market.\n\nBeside producing a shining reverb sound at medium and larger space settings, Sobor is equally great-sounding at ultra-small space settings, going as far as being able to imitate guitar cabinet sound at 100% wet setting.  Sobor can even be used to \u201cre-cabinet\u201d a bass-guitar sound yielding very natural results.\n\nThe early reflections placement and reverb levels are chosen automatically based on a pre-defined model that depends on the \u201cSize\u201d and \u201cAmbience\u201d parameters.  Additionally, the user may specify the \u201cPre-Delay\u201d and \u201cStereo width\u201d parameters.  Sobor is technically based on Feedback Delay Networks (FDNs) with the Hadamard matrix, and uses self-modulation techniques.\n\nSobor is great on any sound sources: vocals, synths, drums, mixes.  This reverb is a relatively CPU-demanding effect (it takes 7.5% of a single core of i7-7700K processor, at 44100 sample rate), for comfortable use it requires a higher-end processor.\n\n## Package Specific\n\n### Package Parameters\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n * `/NoVst2x86`       - Do not install the x86 VST2 version\n * `/NoVst2x64`       - Do not install the x64 VST2 version\n * `/NoVst3x86`       - Do not install the x86 VST3 version\n * `/NoVst3x64`       - Do not install the x64 VST3 version\n * `/NoAaxx86`        - Do not install the x86 AAX version\n * `/NoAaxx64`        - Do not install the x64 AAX version\n * `/NoShortcuts`     - Do not install shortcuts to manuals and uninstaller into start menu or onto desktop\n * `/Vst2Path:`       - Installation path of the VST2 version\n * `/Vst2x86Path:` - Installation path of the x86 VST2 version on x64 CPU architecture\n * `/InstallerPath:`  - Do not download the installer from the official Voxengo website and use the one passed with this argument instead.
