{"description": "MSYS2 is a software distro and building platform for Windows.\n\nAt its core is an independent rewrite of MSYS, based on modern Cygwin (POSIX compatibility layer) and MinGW-w64 with the aim of better interoperability with native Windows software. It provides a bash shell, Autotools, revision control systems and the like for building native Windows applications using MinGW-w64 toolchains.\n\nIt features a package management system to provide easy installation of packages, Pacman. It brings many powerful features such as dependency resolution and simple complete system upgrades, as well as straight-forward package building.\n\n### Ruby integration\n\nThis package can be used with [ruby](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ruby) package to provide native building environment for gems.\n\n- The ruby installer comes with `ridk` function which offers interactive GUI installation wizard of msys2 and hence [can't be used unattended](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/issues/79) (`ridk install 1`).\n- Its system update is the same as initialization done with this package (`ridk install 2`).\n- Ruby installer offers unattended setup of MSYS2 and MINGW development toolchain (`ridk install 3`).\n\nYou can also just install the msys2 package without system update and use `ridk` afterwards:\n\n```powershell\ncinst ruby                        # install ruby\ncinst msys2 --params \"/NoUpdate\"  # install msys2 without system update\nUpdate-SessionEnvironment         # refresh environment vars\nridk install 2 3                  # use ruby's ridk to update the system and install development toolchain\n```\n\n## Package parameters\n\n- `/InstallDir` - Path to installation directory, by default msys will be installed in `Get-ToolsLocation`.\n- `/NoPath`     - Do not add msys installation directory to system PATH.\n- `/NoUpdate`   - Do not automatically update with Pacman according to the [official instructions](https://msys2.github.io).\n\nExample: `choco install msys2 --params \"/NoUpdate /InstallDir:C:\\your\\install\\path\"`\n\n## Notes\n\n- MSYS2 itself will not be installed again on updating or reinstalling the Chocolatey package. Instead, the existing MSYS2 will be updated with Pacman. Manually delete the installation folder to force complete reinstallation.\n- **If the package is out of date please check [Version History](#versionhistory) for the latest submitted version. If you have a question, please ask it in [Chocolatey Community Package Discussions](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages/discussions) or raise an issue on the [Chocolatey Community Packages Repository](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages/issues) if you have problems with the package. Disqus comments will generally not be responded to.**", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:48:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/msys2/20240113.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/msys2/20240113.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/userzimmermann/choco-packages/blob/master/msys2/NOTICE", "packageName": "msys2", "displayName": "MSYS2", "summary": "A Cygwin-derived software distro for Windows using Arch Linux's Pacman", "version": "20240113.0.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages@b7fd5a569573c45748462808cd80dc4b456f79c1/icons/msys2.png", "author": "Alexpux,  martell,  mingwandroid,  elieux,  renatosilva,  niXman", "downloadCount": 825063, "tags": ["msys2", "msys", "cygwin", "mingw", "gnu", "linux", "unix", "posix", "arch", "pacman", "bash", "makepkg", "gcc", "shell", "cli", "foss", "development"]}
