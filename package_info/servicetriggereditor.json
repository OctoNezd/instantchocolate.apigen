{"description": "Service Trigger Editor is a free administrative utility that can add, change, or view the Triggers configured on Windows Services. It runs on all modern versions of Windows.\n\nThe command-line SC tool (sc.exe) is good enough for occasional manipulation of service triggers, always having to resort to the command line becomes a drag.
