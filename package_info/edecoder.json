{"description": "eDecoder is a plugin for the popular archiver 7-Zip. It enables 7-Zip to handle many different types of mailboxes (files that contain email messages) like archives. It also enables 7-Zip to handle email message files like archives. Thanks to eDecoder, you can easily extract an email message or only an email attachment from a mail base without using the email client that created that mail base. Moreover, eDecoder enables 7-Zip to open so-called web archive files (MIME HTML files, which usually have the extension MHT or MHTML), as well as to open or create UUE and XXE encoded files.\n\nThe eDecoder plugin also contains eSplitter. It's a special codec that helps 7-Zip pack text files containing binary data encoded using base64 and some other binary-to-text encoding schemes (for example, web pages saved in the MHTML format, email messages in the EML format, mail bases in the MBOX and TBB formats, illustrated e-books in the FB2 format, and many more) into 7z files more efficiently.\n\nList of formats that can be opened in 7-Zip with eDecoder\n\n- MGS - used by Microsoft Office Outlook\n- TNEF - used by Microsoft Office Outlook (winmail.dat or ATT0001.dat files)\n- DBX - used by Outlook Express 5 and 6\n- MBX - used by Outlook Express 4\n- MBOX - used by the following applications:\nMozilla Thunderbird\nSeaMonkey\nNetscape\nApple Mail\nOpera\nOpera Mail\nEudora\nMulberry\nPine\nPocoMail\nand by many other email clients\n- TBB - used by The Bat!\n- PMM - used by Pegasus Mail\n- EMLX - used by Apple Mail\n- EML, NWS, MHT, MHTML, B64\n- UUE, XXE\n- NTX - YEnc files\n- BIN - MacBinary files\n- HQX - BinHex files\n- WARC - Web ARChive files", "updated": "2024-03-23T04:33:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/edecoder/1.20.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/edecoder/1.20.3", "licenseUrl": "https://www.tc4shell.com/en/termsofuse/", "packageName": "edecoder", "displayName": "edecoder (Install)", "summary": "eDecoder is a plugin for the popular archiver 7-Zip.
