{"description": "# GMS - Groundwater Modeling System\n\n## Speed up & simplify model building with the conceptual model approach in GMS\n\nWe pioneered conceptual modeling and have refined it over many years. That's why GMS is the quickest and most \nintuitive groundwater modeling interface available. Construct a high level representation of the model using \nfamiliar GIS objects: points, arcs and polygons and easily update the model as needed. Conceptual modeling in \nGMS [starting at ,400](https://aquaveo.com/software/gms-pricing) (including 3D visualization)\n\nFor models with simple geometry and boundary conditions, use the grid approach and edit values directly in \nthe grid.\n\n---\n## 3D visualization optimized for performance\n\nGMS is the most advanced software system available for performing groundwater simulations in a three-dimensional \nenvironment.\n\n\n* Interact with models in true 3D\n* Optimized OpenGL graphics for improved hardware rendering\n* Create photo-realistic renderings\n* Generate animations for PowerPoint or web presentations\n* Drape images over the model and control the opacity\n* Annotations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Add north arrows, scale bars, reference images, company logos, and more\n\n---\n## Import a variety of data formats & imagery\n\nModels require data from many different sources. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why GMS is built to easily import numerous file types:\n\n* Raster images including georeference and projection support\n* Topographical maps & elevation data\n* Borehole data including stratigraphy and geophysical data\n* Native MODFLOW files\n* MODFLOW files from Visual MODFLOW, Groundwater Vistas and PM Win\n* Web data services such as TerraServer\n* ArcGIS geodatabases and shapefiles\n* CAD files including .dwg, .dgn, and .dxf formats\n* Worldwide projection support including Cartesian and Geographic Systems\n* File Import wizard for delimited text files and spreadsheets\n\n---\n## Advanced subsurface characterization\n\nFrom cross-section editing to advanced probability statistics, GMS offers unparalleled subsurface modeling tools.\n\n* Generate iso-surfaces from 3D data to visualize plumes\n* Cut cross-sections anywhere through 3D data\n* 2D & 3D geostatistics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Kriging, IDW and Natural Neighbor\n* Robust and fast algorithms to create solids from horizons\n\n---\n## Software from an industry leader\n\nGMS is developed by Aquaveo, an engineering services company with many years of experience developing groundwater modeling solutions.\n\n* Step-by-step tutorials and how-to videos\n* Online community forum and product documentation\n* Phone and email technical support\n* Regularly scheduled training courses taught by expert modelers\n* On-site training available\n* Professional consulting services", "updated": "2024-03-21T23:18:24Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gms/10.5.12", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/gms/10.5.12", "licenseUrl": "http://aquaveo.com/end-user-license-agreement", "packageName": "gms", "displayName": "Groundwater Modeling System (GMS) Software", "summary": "Groundwater and subsurface simulations in a 3D environment.", "version": "10.5.12", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kylebaker/AquaveoChocolateyPackages@master/icons/gms-icon.png", "author": "Aquaveo", "downloadCount": 1816, "tags": ["wms", "aquaveo", "trial"]}
