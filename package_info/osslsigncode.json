{"description": "## WHAT IS IT?\n\nosslsigncode is a small tool that implements part of the functionality\nof the Microsoft tool signtool.exe - more exactly the Authenticode\nsigning and timestamping. But osslsigncode is based on OpenSSL and cURL,\nand thus should be able to compile on most platforms where these exist.\n\n## WHY?\n\nWhy not use signtool.exe? Because I don't want to go to a Windows\nmachine every time I need to sign a binary - I can compile and build\nthe binaries using Wine on my Linux machine, but I can't sign them\nsince the signtool.exe makes good use of the CryptoAPI in Windows, and\nthese APIs aren't (yet?) fully implemented in Wine, so the signtool.exe\ntool  would fail. And, so, osslsigncode was born.\n\n## WHAT CAN IT DO?\n\nIt can sign and timestamp PE (EXE/SYS/DLL/etc), CAB, CAT and MSI files.\nIt supports the equivalent of signtool.exe's \"-j javasign.dll -jp low\",\ni.e. add a valid signature for a CAB file containing Java files.\nIt supports getting the timestamp through a proxy as well. It also\nsupports signature verification, removal and extraction.", "updated": "2024-03-23T15:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/osslsigncode/2.6.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/osslsigncode/2.6.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "osslsigncode", "displayName": "Osslsigncode", "summary": "osslsigncode is a small tool that implements authenticode signing and timestamping", "version": "2.6.0", "icon": "", "author": "Micha\u0142 Trojnara", "downloadCount": 4508, "tags": ["OpenSSL", "signtool", "Authenticode", "signing", "timestamp", "PE", "EXE", "SYS", "DLL", "CAB", "MSI"]}
