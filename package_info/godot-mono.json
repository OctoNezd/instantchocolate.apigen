{"description": "### Godot Engine\n\n#### 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine\n\nGodot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and\n3D games from a unified interface. It provides a comprehensive set of common\ntools, so that users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the\nwheel. Games can be exported in one click to a number of platforms, including\nthe major desktop platforms (Linux, Mac OSX, Windows) as well as mobile\n(Android, iOS) and web-based (HTML5) platforms.\n\n#### Free, open source and community-driven\n\nGodot is completely free and open source under the very permissive MIT license.\nNo strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down\nto the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and\ncommunity-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their\nexpectations. It is supported by the Software Freedom Conservancy\nnot-for-profit.\n\nBefore being open sourced in February 2014, Godot had been developed by Juan\nLinietsky and Ariel Manzur (both still maintaining the project) for several\nyears as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire titles.\n\n![Screenshot of a 3D scene in Godot Engine](https://download.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/media/screenshots/editor_3d_fracteed.jpg)", "updated": "2024-03-22T23:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/godot-mono/4.2.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/godot-mono/4.2.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "godot-mono", "displayName": "Godot Game Engine (Mono version)", "summary": "Multi-platform 2D and 3D game engine", "version": "4.2.1", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joachimschmidt557/chocolatey-packages-manual-automatic/master/icons/godot.png", "author": "Juan Linietsky,  Ariel Manzur and contributors", "downloadCount": 13320, "tags": ["godot", "game", "engine", "game-engine", "graphics", "3d", "2d"]}
