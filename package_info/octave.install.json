{"description": "- Powerful mathematics-oriented syntax with built-in plotting and visualization tools.\n- Free software, runs on GNU/Linux, macOS, BSD, and Windows.\n- Drop-in compatible with many Matlab scripts.\n\n## About\nGNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.\n\nOctave has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary differential and differential-algebraic equations. It is easily extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in Octave\u2019s own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.\n\nGNU Octave is also freely redistributable software.
