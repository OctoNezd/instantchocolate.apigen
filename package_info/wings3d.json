Many commands let you pick an extra vector or point that the command should operate upon. Command variations are initiated by selecting the command using the different mouse buttons. In the Info Line, the mouse buttons are abbreviated to L, M, and R.\n\n### Tools\nWings 3D has a comprehensive set of mesh modeling and selection tools.\n\n- Standard tools such as Move, Scale, Rotate, Extrude, Bevel, Bridge, Cut, and Weld.\n- Advanced tools including: Sweep, Plane Cut, Circularise, Intersect, Bend, Shear, and Inset.\n- Magnets and Magnet Masking\n- Virtual Mirror for symmetrical modeling\n- Tweak and Sculpt\n- Edge Loop and Edge Ring selection and navigation tools\n- Smooth Preview\n- Much, MUCH more!\n\n### AutoUV\nAdd textures to your model using the AutoUV facility.
