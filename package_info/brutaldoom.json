{"description": "=== BrutalDoom Mod (https://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom) for Windows ===\n====    ====    ====    ====    ====    ====    ====\nIn development since 2010, the 18th Cacoward winner and Moddb 2012 MOTY Editors Choice of Creativity Award Br\u00fctal Doom takes Doom into a whole new level. It makes the game much more violent than before. There's much more blood, plus it adds unique gibs, death animations, dismemberments, headshots, executions, fire and explosion particles, flares, and much more.\n\nThe whole world becomes more real and interactive.You can kick severed limbs and heads (and sometimes, use it to activate some traps in the map earlier, or even kick them against enemies to do some damage), you can shoot enemies' heads to deal more damage (and cause more gruesome deaths) you can destroy most things in the the scenario (trees, lamps, hanging bodies, etc), you can paint the floor, the walls, and even the ceiling with blood, you can push the explosive barrels to make traps, or grab them and use like an explosive weapon, you can silently take down enemies from behind and perform stealth kills, the chainsaw actually cuts the enemies in two. When you find the berserk pack and get super strength, you can perform cinematic executions and RIP AND TEAR your foes with your bare hands. Some enemies will scream in anguish and try to crawl away when near death, and they can be used as human shields, and much, much more.\n\nEverything in Brutal Doom is extremely intense. Everything sounds louder, looks bigger, moves faster, and hits harder. You can even fell the impact of explosions. Enemies are harder and smarter, and weapons and explosions are much louder. Your weapons have been upgraded to a deadly arsenal, completely throwing the vanilla Doom's \"progressive weapon system\" through the window. Every weapon is powerful and have it's pros and cons, a a weapon will never be outclassed when you find a new weapon, but only find a different use for different situations, making Brutal Doom more balanced and more strategic than Vanilla gameplay. You have new abilities too. With any weapon selected, you can press Q (default bind) to kick enemies at close range and send them away. Every new feature and weapon is cautiously balanced, and added in a way that makes sense in the universe of Doom. Many of the features can also be disabled/enabled to provide the best personal experience possible.\n\nBr\u00fctal Doom will make the good an old Doom have a new and fresh look. It will give you a reason to play all the Ultimate Doom, Doom 2, and Final Doom levels again. This mod also works with almost every megawad and map pack around. Take a breath, and prepare to RIP AND TEAR HUGE GUTS!!!!!\n\n\n\nAlso Check the Official Facebook page: [Facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/BrutalDoom)\nAnd my Youtube Channel: [Youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/user/SGtMarkIV?feature=watch)\n\nBefore making any questions related to the mod, or problems to make it work, please read the FAQ.\n[Moddb.com](https://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/features/brutal-doom-faq-and-troubleshooting)\n====    ====    ====    ====    ====    ====    ====", "updated": "2024-03-21T20:18:48Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/brutaldoom/21.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/brutaldoom/21.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.moddb.com/terms-of-use", "packageName": "brutaldoom", "displayName": "brutaldoom (Install)", "summary": "Compiled version of Brutal Doom for Windows", "version": "21.0.0", "icon": "https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4296/4295223/brutal_doom_ico.png", "author": "[Sergeant_Mark_IV](https://www.moddb.com/members/sergeant-mark-iv)", "downloadCount": 1882, "tags": ["brutaldoom", "doom", "freedoom", "zandronum"]}
