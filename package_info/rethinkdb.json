{"description": "RethinkDB is the first open-source scalable database built for realtime applications. It exposes a new database access model -- instead of polling for changes, the developer can tell the database to continuously push updated query results to applications in realtime. RethinkDB allows developers to build scalable realtime apps in a fraction of the time with less effort.\n\nTo learn more, check out [rethinkdb.com](https://rethinkdb.com/).\n\n## Features\n\n- **Open-source** database for building reastime web applications\n- **NoSQL** database that stores schemaless JSON documents\n- **Distributed** database that is easy to scale\n- **High availability** database with automatic failover and robust fault tolerance", "updated": "2024-03-21T11:03:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rethinkdb/2.3.6", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/rethinkdb/2.3.6", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/v2.3.6/COPYRIGHT", "packageName": "rethinkdb", "displayName": "RethinkDB", "summary": "The open-source database for the realtime web", "version": "2.3.6", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AdmiringWorm/chocolatey-packages@e2b844c94b052109fa3a17c25c7ab383e571ec62/automatic/rethinkdb/icons/rethinkdb.svg", "author": "Sam Hughes,  Daniel Mewes,  Timothy Maxwell", "downloadCount": 1685, "tags": ["rethinkdb", "database", "json", "realtime", "nosql", "cross-platform", "foss"]}
