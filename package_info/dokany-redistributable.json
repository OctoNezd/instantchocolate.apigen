{"description": "![Deprecated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/mylogos/deprecated.png)\t\n\t\n##This package has been deprecated. \n\nThis package has been deprecated in favor of the [dokany](https://chocolatey.org/packages/dokany) package. \n\nThis redistributable package is the same as the [dokany](https://chocolatey.org/packages/dokany) package with the addition of [KB2999226](https://chocolatey.org/packages/KB2999226) and [vcredist2017](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vcredist2017) bundled in. These dependencies are already part of the [dokany](https://chocolatey.org/packages/dokany) package, making this one redundant.
