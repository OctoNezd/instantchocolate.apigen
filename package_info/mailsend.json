{"description": "*mailsend* is a simple command line program to send mail via http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0821.txt?number=821[SMTP] protocol. Long time ago, I needed to send a piece of alert mail from a program in a networked Windows machine, but could not find a simple program like this installed. So I wrote one. You might find it useful as well. The program does not use any config file and I plan to keep it that way. *From version 1.17b1+, IPv6 is supported in all platforms.* Suggestions, bug reports are always welcome.
