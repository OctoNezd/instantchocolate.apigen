{"description": "Ftpdmin is a minimal Windows FTP server. FTP does not require an \"install\". It is intended to be run temporarily, on an as-needed basis basis to do file transfers between Windows computers without going thru the trouble of trying to configure windows file sharing or an FTP server. Also useful for Windows to Linux if the Linux computer doesn't happen to have an FTP server already set up and configured.\n\nFtpdmin is not intended as an internet FTP server, or even intended to be left running. Rather, Ftpdmin is started from the command line so that another computer can connect to it via FTP, typically over a LAN. When the file transfers are done, stop Ftpdmin. No 'installation' is necessary to use it.\n\nFtpdmin has no notion of security or even passwords. Rather, once it is running, everyone can connect to it. The only resemblance of security is the -g option (get only, disallows put), and the ability to specify a directory that ftpdmin shall consider the root directory.", "updated": "2024-03-19T19:18:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ftpdmin/0.96", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ftpdmin/0.96", "licenseUrl": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/", "packageName": "ftpdmin", "displayName": "Ftpdmin", "summary": "Simple ad-hoc file transfer Windows FTP server", "version": "0.96", "icon": "", "author": "Matthias Wandel", "downloadCount": 2071, "tags": ["ftp", "server", "cli"]}
