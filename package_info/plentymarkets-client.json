{"description": "We developed the plentymarkets Client so that you can work with plentymarkets outside of a web browser and have direct access to local devices such as your printer. Our innovative process editor is also only available in this tool. Here you can map your company's processes and carry them out automatically. You can also automatically print documents and register important data with a barcode scanner, for example.", "updated": "2024-03-23T15:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/plentymarkets-client/229.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/plentymarkets-client/229.3", "licenseUrl": "https://www.plentymarkets.eu/unternehmen/agb/", "packageName": "plentymarkets-client", "displayName": "plentymarkets Client", "summary": "plentymarkets Client", "version": "229.3", "icon": "", "author": "plentymarkets GmbH", "downloadCount": 602, "tags": ["plentymarkets", "admin"]}
