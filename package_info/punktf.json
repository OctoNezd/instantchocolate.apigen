{"description": "## Yet another dotfile manager?!\n\nWell, yes, but hear me out: This project was driven by the personal need of having to manage several dotfiles for different machines/targets. You want the same experience everywhere: On your Windows workstation along with an Ubuntu WSL instance, your Debian server and your private Arch installation. This tool fixes that problem while being cross-platform and blazingly fast. You won't need multiple sets of dotfile configurations ever again!\n\n## Features\n\n- Compile and deploy your dotfiles with one command across different platforms\n- Use handlebar-like instructions to insert variables and compile sections conditionally\n- Define pre- and post-hooks to customize the behavior with your own commands\n- Create multiple profiles for different targets\n- Works on Windows and Linux", "updated": "2024-03-05T16:48:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/punktf/3.1.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/punktf/3.1.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/Shemnei/punktf/blob/main/LICENSE-MIT", "packageName": "punktf", "displayName": "punktf (Install)", "summary": "A cross-platform multi-target dotfiles manager", "version": "3.1.1", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/michidk/choco/3fd7bbd83f1326ea3b38d7b03fe345419718e468/icons/punktf.png", "author": "Jonas Grawe,  Michael Lohr", "downloadCount": 764, "tags": ["dotfiles", "rust", "cli", "dotfile", "dotfiles-manager"]}
