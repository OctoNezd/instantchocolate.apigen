The 100% Chocolatey user OPT-IN toast notification extension for Chocolatey and Windows 10 (only).\n\n### **Chocolatey Toast Notifications Extension** is a Chocolatey extension that displays a toast notification after installing or uninstalling a program. This extension will start working automatically once installed and does NOT need to be implemented by package creators/maintainers. **Chocolatey Toast Notifications Extension** is meant to be installed and used directly by Chocolatey end users.\n\n### PURPOSE:\n\n* Chocogeeky fun!\n\n### FEATURES: \n* **Chocolatey Toast Notifications Extension** will display a toast notification with the package name, program name, program version, status message (installed or uninstalled), and a link to the package page on the chocolatey.org website after a program is installed or uninstalled.\n\n### WHAT IT WON'T DO:\n* **Chocolatey Toast Notifications Extension** will NOT work on anything other than Windows 10, this is a limitation of the [BurntToast](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast) PowerShell module and its use of the [UWP Community Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsCommunityToolkit). (Yes, I tried it on Windows Server 2016 and it did NOT work.)\n* **Chocolatey Toast Notifications Extension** will NOT display messages for programs that don't use standard installers, i.e. portable programs.\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/chocolatey-toast-notifications.extension_extras/readme.md)**\n\n    \n\n---\n\n**Click here to [Patreon-ize](https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3) the package maintainer.**\n\n---", "updated": "2024-03-23T21:18:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey-toast-notifications.extension/0.0.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/chocolatey-toast-notifications.extension/0.0.4", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html", "packageName": "chocolatey-toast-notifications.extension", "displayName": "Chocolatey Toast Notifications Extension", "summary": "Chocolatey Toast Notifications Extension is a Chocolatey extension that displays a toast notification after installing or uninstalling a program.", "version": "0.0.4", "icon": "https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/mylogos/myunofficialChocolateylogo_icon.png", "author": "Bill Curran", "downloadCount": 4603, "tags": ["bcurran3", "unofficial", "choco", "toast", "notifications", "extension"]}
