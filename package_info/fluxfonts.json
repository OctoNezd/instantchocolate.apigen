{"description": "Fluxfonts is a specialized tool that attempts to tackle the privacy concerns raised by the possibility to collect information about the fonts installed on a system. Such information can be used to uniquely identify a system. With Fluxfonts, new fonts are randomly created and removed to prevent the same fingerprint from being recreated.\n\nNew fonts are generated by the daemon every 2 to 40 minutes. Fonts are generated at random times in this time window. However, they are generated more often when not running on battery power.\n\nFont fingerprinting is a technique which is difficult and usually inconvenient for users to circumvent by other means. Fluxfonts is fully automated and runs in the background. By effectively always having a new unique fingerprint, it should prevent a system from being (re-)identified between applications and websites/-browsers.", "updated": "2024-03-21T23:03:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/fluxfonts/2.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/fluxfonts/2.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/da2x/fluxfonts/master/COPYING", "packageName": "fluxfonts", "displayName": "Fluxfonts - font fingerprint cloaking.", "summary": "A continual font generator for increased privacy.", "version": "2.0", "icon": "", "author": "Daniel Aleksandersen", "downloadCount": 572, "tags": ["fluxfonts", "security", "privacy", "continual", "font", "generator"]}
