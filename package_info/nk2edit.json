This feature is known as 'AutoComplete' and Outlook automatically build this emails list according to user activity and save it into a file with .NK2 extension.\n\nIn some circumstances, you may need to repair or modify the values appeared in the AutoComplete list, or you may want to remove unwanted email addresses and/or to add new email addresses. MS-Outlook doesn't provide any ability to edit this AutoComplete list, so this is where NK2Edit software can help you.", "updated": "2024-03-21T15:48:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/nk2edit/3.35", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/nk2edit/3.35", "licenseUrl": "http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/outlook_nk2_edit.html", "packageName": "nk2edit", "displayName": "NK2Edit", "summary": "Edit AutoComplete files (.NK2) of Microsoft Outlook", "version": "3.35", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/2697586f564894b3346352497da46f320a02e725/icons/nk2edit.png", "author": "Nir Sofer", "downloadCount": 5484, "tags": ["repair", "autocomplete", "outlook"]}
