{"description": "SpleeterMsvcExe is a Windows command line program for Spleeter, which can be used directly.\nIt is written in pure C language, using ffmpeg to read and write audio files, and using Tensorflow C API to make use of Spleeter models. No need to install Python environment, and it does not contain anything related to Python.\nFurthermore, SpleeterMsvcExe reduced the memory usage through segmented processing, hence it can handle single audio file over 30 minutes. Due to the length-extending process, all segments can be concatenated seamlessly.", "updated": "2024-03-14T16:19:03Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/spleeter-msvc-exe/1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/spleeter-msvc-exe/1.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/wudicgi/SpleeterMsvcExe/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "spleeter-msvc-exe", "displayName": "spleeter-msvc-exe", "summary": "Windows command line program for Spleeter, written in pure C, no need of Python", "version": "1.0", "icon": "", "author": "wudicgi", "downloadCount": 324, "tags": ["audio", "music", "separate", "inst", "vocal"]}
