{"description": "The mpg123 distribution contains a real time MPEG 1.0/2.0/2.5 audio player/decoder for layers 1,2 and 3 (most commonly MPEG 1.0 layer 3 aka MP3), as well as re-usable decoding and output libraries. Among others, it works on GNU/Linux, MacOSX, the BSDs, Solaris, AIX, HPUX, SGI Irix, OS/2 and Cygwin or plain MS Windows (not all more exotic platforms tested regularily, but patches welcome). You may jump to the non-exhaustive list of features.  \n\nIt is free software licensed under LGPL 2.1 .  \n\nNote that nowadays, the mpg123 decoder core can work with floating point or integer math and with some tuning between accuracy and performance at build-time, using assembly optimizations for several platforms, depending on your build configuration. There is detection and selection of assembly optimisations on x86, x86-64, and ARM at program runtime. It's fast, it's high-quality. Just use it.", "updated": "2024-03-21T01:34:08Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/mpg123/1.24.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/mpg123/1.24.0", "licenseUrl": "https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/LGPLv2", "packageName": "mpg123", "displayName": "mpg123", "summary": "Cross-platform CLI music player.", "version": "1.24.0", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/Kristinita/SashaChocolatey/master/icons/{{PACKAGE}}.png", "author": "Michael Hipp,  Thomas Orgis", "downloadCount": 1925, "tags": ["mpg123", "mp3", "mp3-player", "player"]}
