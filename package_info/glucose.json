{"description": "# The Glucose SAT Solver\nGlucose is based on a new scoring scheme for the clause learning mechanism of so called \"Modern\" SAT solvers (it is based on [this paper](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/09/Papers/074.pdf)). \n\n![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jakublevy/chocopkgs/glucose/glue.png)\n\nGlucose is designed to be parallel since 2014. The name of the Solver is a contraction of the concept of \"glue clauses\", a particular kind of clauses that glucose detects and preserves during search.\n\n### For more information about Glucose see [the official page](https://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose).", "updated": "2024-03-15T10:33:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/glucose/4.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/glucose/4.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/jakublevy/glucose-win/blob/master/LICENCE", "packageName": "glucose", "displayName": "The Glucose SAT Solver", "summary": "Glucose is award-winning modern SAT Solver heavily based on Minisat with multi-threading support.", "version": "4.1", "icon": "", "author": "Gilles Audemard, Laurent Simon", "downloadCount": 317, "tags": ["sat", "solver", "sat-solver", "sat-solving", "minisat", "cnf", "dimacs"]}
