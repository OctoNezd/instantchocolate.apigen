{"description": "Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn\u2019t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.\n    \n![Roboto sample](https://i1.wp.com/www.downloadfonts.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Roboto-Font.jpg)\n\nRoboto is the default font on Android and Chrome OS, and the recommended font for Google\u2019s visual language, Material Design.\n\n## Options\nBy default this package installs the *hinted* version of both of the related, \"Normal\" and \"Condensed\" Roboto families of fonts, but can optionally install just one family using a `/Normal` or `/Condensed` package parameter.\n\n* Examples:   \n    `choco install roboto.font --params '\"/Normal\"'`   \n    `choco install roboto.font --params '\"/Condensed\"'`", "updated": "2024-03-23T13:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/roboto.font/3.9.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/roboto.font/3.9.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/googlefonts/roboto-classic/blob/main/OFL.txt", "packageName": "roboto.font", "displayName": "Roboto (Classic) Font", "summary": "Google\u2019s signature family of fonts", "version": "3.9.0", "icon": "", "author": "Christian Robertson", "downloadCount": 2222, "tags": ["roboto.font", "roboto", "font", "googlefonts", "ttf", "FOSS", "embedded"]}
