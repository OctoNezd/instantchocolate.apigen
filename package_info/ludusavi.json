The data is ultimately sourced from [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home),\nso please contribute any new or fixed data back to the wiki itself, and your\nimprovements will be incorporated into Ludusavi's data as well.\n\nIf you'd like to help translate Ludusavi into other languages,\n[check out the Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/ludusavi).\n\n## Demo\n### GUI\n![GUI demo of previewing a backup](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/mtkennerly/ludusavi/v0.22.0/docs/demo-gui.gif)\n\n### CLI\n![CLI demo of previewing a backup](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/mtkennerly/ludusavi/v0.22.0/docs/demo-cli.gif)\n\n## Usage\n\nFor Usage, see https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/blob/v0.22.0/README.md\n\n## Configuration\nLudusavi stores its configuration in the following locations:\n\n* Windows: `%APPDATA%/ludusavi`\n* Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ludusavi` or `~/.config/ludusavi`\n* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/ludusavi`\n\nAlternatively, if you'd like Ludusavi to store its configuration in the same\nplace as the executable, then simply create a file called `ludusavi.portable`\nin the directory that contains the executable file. You might want to do that\nif you're going to run Ludusavi from a flash drive on multiple computers.\n\nIf you're using the GUI, then it will automatically update the config file\nas needed, so you don't need to worry about its content. However, if you're\nusing the CLI exclusively, then you'll need to edit `config.yaml` yourself.\n\nLudusavi also stores `manifest.yaml` (info on what to back up) here.\nYou should not modify that file, because Ludusavi will overwrite your changes\nwhenever it downloads a new copy.", "updated": "2024-03-22T17:33:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ludusavi/0.22.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ludusavi/0.22.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/blob/v0.22.0/LICENSE", "packageName": "ludusavi", "displayName": "Ludusavi", "summary": "Backup tool for PC game saves.", "version": "0.22.0", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/mtkennerly/ludusavi/v0.22.0/assets/icon.min.svg", "author": "Matthew T.
