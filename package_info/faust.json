{"description": "Faust (Functional Audio Stream) is a functional programming language specifically designed for real-time signal processing and synthesis. A distinctive characteristic of Faust is that it is fully compiled.\n\nThe Faust compiler translates DSP specifications into very efficient code for various languages (C++, C, JAVA, LLVM IR, WebAssembly etc.) working at sample level. It targets high-performance signal processing applications, libraries, and audio plug-ins for a variety of audio platforms and standards. A same Faust specification can be used to easily generate various kinds of native standalone applications, iOS and Android apps, as well as Csound, LADSPA, Max/MSP, PD, Q, SuperCollider, VST, AU plugins, etc. (see the README in the /architecture folder for an exhaustive list).\n\nWhile there are Faust contributors everywhere across the globe, Faust is mainly being developed at Grame, Centre National de Creation Musicale (https://www.grame.fr), its birthplace.", "updated": "2024-03-22T04:03:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/faust/2.70.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/faust/2.70.3", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/tree/master-dev#License-1-ov-file", "packageName": "faust", "displayName": "Faust - Programming Language for Audio Applications and Plugins", "summary": "Functional programming language for signal processing and sound synthesis", "version": "2.70.3", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/grame-cncm/faust/f0c79c111bda3280bd6c3937485eb7fbecd8f51e/build/package/faust-310x310.png", "author": "grame-cncm", "downloadCount": 25, "tags": ["audio", "c", "rust", "c-plus-plus", "csharp", "compiler", "cpp", "functional-programming", "julia", "dsp", "llvm", "dlang", "julia-language", "wasm", "faust", "jsfx", "jax", "cmajor", "rnbo"]}
