{"description": "This is Twangstr\u00f6m, a flexible spring-reverb box-of-tricks. If you're familiar with Bazille you might already have come across its built-in spring unit. We took that one, and modelled two more reverb tanks, paired it with drive section, filter stage, envelope, and mod matrix.\nIn Twangstr\u00f6m, tanks are based on 'physical modelling'. As opposed to plug-ins using impulse responses (IRs) of actual devices but being limited in expression and manipulation, our approach mimics the actual physics of mechanical reverberation. Thus we're not reproducing sonic results, we're actually simulating their origin. And it's all controllable in realtime, on a per-sample-basis. Which boils down to quite some power at your fingertips.\n\n## Package Specific\n\n### Package Parameters\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n * `/NoVst2x86`       - Do not install the x86 VST2 version\n * `/NoVst2x64`       - Do not install the x64 VST2 version\n * `/NoVst3x86`       - Do not install the x86 VST3 version\n * `/NoVst3x64`       - Do not install the x64 VST3 version\n * `/NoAaxx86`        - Do not install the x86 AAX version\n * `/NoAaxx64`        - Do not install the x64 AAX version\n * `/NoPresets`       - Do not install factory presets\n * `/NoNks`           - Do not install the nks integration\n * `/Vst2Path:`       - Installation path of the VST2 version\n * `/Vst2x86Path:`    - Installation path of the x86 VST2 version on x64 CPU architecture\n * `/UserFolderPath:` - Path of the user data (presets, settings, themes) to link outside factory data (optional)\n * `/CompanyPath:`    - Path of the company to put all program files in. Override if you want to have the program files at a custom location. Attention: u-he program files are expected to be directly writeable (no UAC involved) by the user running the software.\n\nYou must pass the package parameters like this:\n```\nchoco install uhe-twangstrom --package-parameters \"'/NoVst2x64 /Vst2x86Path:${env:CommonProgramFiles(x86)}\\VST2\\u-he '\"\n```", "updated": "2024-03-05T22:48:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/uhe-twangstrom/1.0.12092", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/uhe-twangstrom/1.0.12092", "licenseUrl": "https://u-he.com/about/eula.html", "packageName": "uhe-twangstrom", "displayName": "Twangstr\u00f6m (Install)", "summary": "A spring reverb by u-he.", "version": "1.0.12092", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/Schroedingers-Cat/chocolatey-audio-plugins/a38c089d2a528cb75df73ef9ea46269589782c91/Icons/u-he/twangstrom.png", "author": "u-he", "downloadCount": 747, "tags": ["twangstrom", "audio", "u-he", "vst", "effect", "delay", "aax", "admin", "trial"]}
