{"description": "Pyzo is a cross-platform Python IDE focused on interactivity and introspection, which makes it very suitable for scientific computing. Its practical design is aimed at simplicity and efficiency. It consists of two main components, the editor and the shell, and uses a set of pluggable tools to help the programmer in various ways. Some example tools are source structure, project manager, interactive help, workspace ... Pyzo is written in (pure) Python 3 and uses the Qt GUI toolkit. Binaries are provided for all major operating system. After installing Pyzo, it can be used to execute code on any Python version available on your system (Python 2.4 - 3.x, including Pypy).\n\n## Disclaimer\npyzo.portable has been flagged as part of automated virus scanning.\nAccording https://github.com/pyzo/pyzo/issues/800 : _It can be assumed that the widespread use of Pyzo also means that people writing malicious code use Python with PyInstaller, just like we do. This might explain why [many binaries build with PyInstaller seem to be affected.](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/6062)_\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/pyzo.portable/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-22T03:48:43Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pyzo.portable/4.15.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pyzo.portable/4.15.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyzo/pyzo/master/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "pyzo.portable", "displayName": "Pyzo (Portable)", "summary": "Pyzo is a cross-platform Python IDE focused on interactivity and introspection, which makes it very suitable for scientific computing.", "version": "4.15.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/pyzo.portable/pyzo.portable.png", "author": "Pyzo Team.", "downloadCount": 1442, "tags": ["pyzo.portable", "IDE", "Python", "editor"]}
