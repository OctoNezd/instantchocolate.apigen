Every important part is optimized for speed, which results in extremely fast browsing, seeking, and playback.\n\n## Lightweight\n\nA couple of files, a few megabytes, low memory footprint, and tidy use of disk space.\n\nNo bloated runtime packages are required.\n\nDLL files are not loaded on startup, but whenever they are required, which tailors memory usage to your behavior.\n\n## Pure Sound\n\nIn order to achieve the **purest sound quality**, there is absolutely nothing between decoded audio and sound output that might degrade quality, which is essential for both sound and sample previewing and audiophile audio playback.\n\nResonic's audio engine runs on 32-bit floating point data.\n\n## Clean Interface\n\nA major design goal is to always keep the graphical user interface **clutter-free** and **user-friendly**, without nested menus and dialogs, and without dumbing down the more powerful features.", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:33:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/resonic/0.9.1.1690", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/resonic/0.9.1.1690", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "resonic", "displayName": "Resonic Player (Install)", "summary": "Fast and free audio player.", "version": "0.9.1.1690", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/joachimschmidt557/chocolatey-packages-manual-automatic/552ff6a5/icons/Resonic.png", "author": "Liqube Audio", "downloadCount": 1165, "tags": ["resonic.install", "resonic", "player", "music", "mp3", "wav", "flac", "ogg", "opus", "wma"]}
