{"description": "Encrypt and decrypt whole files or their parts using AES, Triple-DES (3DES), RC2, and DES symmetric algorithms. You can encrypt files with a single password or specify cryptographic keys (vectors) instead. You can change key bit length for better protection. You can select specifically which bytes in a file should be encrypted/decrypted, though by default the whole file is processed.\nProcess 1000s of files using multiple CPU cores in manual, automatic/continuous, triggered/scheduled, or console modes, or directly from Windows Explorer right-click menu. Save files to output directory specified using either absolute or relative path, with original or new name defined by a mask. Select files for processing based on their name, dates, size, and contents using advanced file search supporting RegEx and advanced wildcards. Optionally merge together, split all, or zip processed files. Perform different operations on different files with conditional processing and process branching. Detailed processing logs are available in both user interface and log files. Run multiple program instances simultaneously.\n\n    Note: This is a fully functional trial version. Processed files are limited in size.", "updated": "2024-03-22T21:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/batch-file-encrypt/5.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/batch-file-encrypt/5.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.binarymark.com/eula.aspx", "packageName": "batch-file-encrypt", "displayName": "Batch File Encrypt", "summary": "Encrypt and decrypt multiple files with ease", "version": "5.0.0", "icon": "https://www.binarymark.com/img/box/box31_std.png", "author": "BinaryMark", "downloadCount": 883, "tags": ["batch-file-encrypt", "batch", "multiple", "bulk", "mass", "files", "encrypt", "file-encryption", "decrypt", "aes", "3-des", "trial", "admin"]}
