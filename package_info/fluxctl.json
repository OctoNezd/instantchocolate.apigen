{"description": "# Flux legacy CLI\n\n### Managing Flux from the Command Line\n> Notice! [Flux v1 is in maintenance mode](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/issues/3320). The next iteration of the Flux command line interface (v2) is being renamed to '[flux](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/flux)'.  Please refer to [this issue for detailed information](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/issues/3320). \n\nFlux allows you to declaratively define the deployment state of your Kubernetes environment.  Deployements are automated and triggered off of code pushes.\nFlux is a tool that automatically ensures that the state of a cluster matches your specified configuration in git. It uses an operator in the cluster to trigger deployments inside Kubernetes, which means you don't need a separate CD tool.\n    It monitors all relevant image repositories, detects new images, triggers deployments and updates the desired running configuration based on that (and a configurable policy).\n\n### Additional Documentation\n\nMore information can be found at the official [FluxCD site](https://fluxcd.io/) and [Flux GitHub repository](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux).\nThe following links provide additional documentation on GitOps, Flux.\n\n* [What you need to know about GitOps - Weaveworks Blog](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/)\n* [GitOps - Operations by Pull Request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSqE2RqctNs)\n* [Flux (legacy/v1)](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux)", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:18:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/fluxctl/1.25.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/fluxctl/1.25.4", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "fluxctl", "displayName": "Flux legacy CLI", "summary": "An optional command line interface to be used with Flux", "version": "1.25.4", "icon": "", "author": "Flux project", "downloadCount": 9967, "tags": ["flux", "fluxctl", "gitops", "kubernetes", "devops", "cli", "docker", "containers"]}
