{"description": "Mule is a lightweight integration platform that allows you to connect anything anywhere. Rather than creating point-to-point integrations between systems, services, APIs and devices, you can use Mule to intelligently manage message-routing, data mapping, orchestration, reliability, security and scalability between nodes. Plug other systems and applications into Mule and let it handle all the communication between systems, enabling you to track and monitor everything that happens. Mule requires a 32 bit JDK 8 in order to run.\n\n### Optional installation commands:\n\n`choco install muleesb -params \"unzipLocation=*path*\"` to specify the root directory for the Mule service. This defaults to `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mulesoft\\Community`.\nNote: An mule-standalone-3.8.1 folder is always created, so the actual install path is `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mulesoft\\Community\\mule-standalone-3.8.1` for the default case or *path*\\mule-standalone-3.8.1 with a custom option.", "updated": "2024-03-23T04:48:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/muleesb/3.8.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/muleesb/3.8.1", "licenseUrl": "https://developer.mulesoft.com/licensing-mule-esb", "packageName": "muleesb", "displayName": "Mule ESB CE", "summary": "Application Server.
