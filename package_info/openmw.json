{"description": "**OpenMW** is a free, open source and modern engine based which reimplements and extends the one that runs the 2002 open-world RPG Morrowind. The engine comes with its own editor , called **OpenMW-CS** which allows the user to edit or create their own original games. Both OpenMW-CS and OpenMW are written from scratch and aren\u2019t made to support any third party programs the original Morrowind engine uses to improve its functionality.\n\n**NOTE:** Playing Morrowind with this engine still requires the Morrowind data files from a copy that you own.", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:18:48Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/openmw/0.48.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/openmw/0.48.0", "licenseUrl": "https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/raw/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "openmw", "displayName": "OpenMW", "summary": "OpenMW - Open source Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind engine reimplementation", "version": "0.48.0", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/ananace/chocolatey-packages/1adeb04799a706879edc60fcd65dc43dd064674b/Icons/openmw.png", "author": "OpenMW Team", "downloadCount": 17621, "tags": ["openmw", "admin", "game", "rpg"]}
