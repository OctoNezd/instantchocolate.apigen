{"description": "Source Sans was designed by Paul D. Hunt under the guidance of Robert Slimbach. It was Adobe's first open source typeface family, conceived primarily as a typeface for user interfaces. Source Sans draws inspiration from the clarity and legibility of twentieth-century American gothic typeface designs. Distilling the best archetypical qualities of these models, Paul followed a rational design approach by simplifying glyph shapes by paring them to their essential form. However, in order to more easily differentiate similar letter shapes (such as uppercase I and lowercase L), some additional details have been added. Besides providing such explicitly clarity in short text strings, another fundamental design consideration was to create a typeface that reads well in extended settings. This can be seen in the general proportions: Source Sans has been designed with a more generous width than many other comparable gothics, and its shorter majuscule letters, combined with minuscule letters with longer extenders, create a more pleasant reading texture in longer text passages.\n\nThis package installs the `.ttf` files in the variable variant.", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:33:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/adobe-source-sans/3.052", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/adobe-source-sans/3.052", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans/blob/release/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "adobe-source-sans", "displayName": "Source Sans Font", "summary": "Sans serif font family for user interface environments.", "version": "3.052", "icon": "", "author": "Adobe Inc.,  Paul D.
