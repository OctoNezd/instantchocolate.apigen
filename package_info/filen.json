{"description": "Filen is a fully zero knowledge end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and communication platform. Zero knowledge end-to-end encryption means that there is no intermediary. Filen (or any of it\u2019s employees) never has access to the user\u2019s encryption keys and therefore data transmitted or stored on the platform truly remains in the user\u2019s hands. \n\n**32 bit users**: This package is not available for 32 bit users.\n\n**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package.
