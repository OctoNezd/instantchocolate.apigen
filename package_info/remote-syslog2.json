{"description": "remote_syslog tails one or more log files and sends syslog messages to a\nremote central syslog server. It generates packets itself, ignoring the system\nsyslog daemon, so its configuration doesn't affect system-wide logging.\n\nUses:\n\n * Collecting logs from servers & daemons which don't natively support syslog\n * When reconfiguring the system logger is less convenient than a\n   purpose-built daemon (e.g., automated app deployments)\n * Aggregating files not generated by daemons (e.g., package manager logs)\n\nThis code is tested with the hosted log management service [Papertrail]\nand should work for transmitting to any syslog server.\n\nremote_syslog2 is a rewrite of the ruby [remote_syslog] package. Not all\nfeatures of the ruby version are supported, and there are some backwards\nincompatible changes.\n\n[Papertrail]: http://papertrailapp.com/", "updated": "2024-03-17T14:18:24Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/remote-syslog2/0.21", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/remote-syslog2/0.21", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/papertrail/remote_syslog2/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "remote-syslog2", "displayName": "remote_syslog2", "summary": "Self-contained daemon for reading local files and emitting remote syslog (without using local syslogd)", "version": "0.21", "icon": "https://galeksandrp.github.io/au-packages/icons/remote-syslog2.png", "author": "Papertrail Inc.", "downloadCount": 2365, "tags": ["remote_syslog", "remote-syslog", "remote_syslog2", "remote-syslog2", "rsyslog", "syslog", "papertrail", "log", "logs", "logging"]}
