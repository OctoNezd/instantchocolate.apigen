FTP backup is also supported in both directions (download and upload).\n\nCobian Backup exists in two different versions: application and service. The program uses very few resources and can be running on the background on your system, checking your backup schedule and executing your backups when necessary.\n\nCobian Backup is not an usual backup application: it only copies your files and folders in original or compressed mode to other destination, creating a security copy as a result. So Cobian Backup can be better described as a \"Scheduler for security copies\". Cobian Backup supports several methods of compression and strong encryption.\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/cobian-backup/readme.md)**\n\n    \n\n---\n\n**Click here to [Patreon-ize](https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3) the package maintainer.**\n\n---", "updated": "2024-03-22T19:03:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/cobian-backup/11.2.0.582001", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/cobian-backup/11.2.0.582001", "licenseUrl": "http://www.cobiansoft.com/cobianbackup.htm", "packageName": "cobian-backup", "displayName": "Cobian Backup 11 (Gravity) (Install)", "summary": "Cobian Backup is a multi-threaded program that can be used to schedule and backup your files and directories from their original location to other directories/drives in the same computer or other computer in your network.
