{"description": "It is designed to be a dual-screen reader used for presentations and public talks, with two displays: the *Content window* for a projector, and the *Presenter window* for your laptop. It is portable and has been tested on various Mac, Windows and Linux systems.\n\nIt comes with many great features:\n- supports embedded videos (when VLC is installed\\*)\n- text annotations displayed in the presenter window\n- natively supports beamer's *notes on second screen*!\n\n\\*) Install VLC at any time and Pympress will autodetect it on its next run. We recommend doing `cinst pympress vlc`. If you choose alternative ways, be sure to install VLC in the same bitness as Pympress, e.g. either both 32-bit or both 64-bit.", "updated": "2024-03-23T15:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pympress/1.7.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pympress/1.7.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/Cimbali/pympress/blob/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "pympress", "displayName": "Pympress", "summary": "Pympress is a little PDF reader written in Python using Poppler for PDF rendering and GTK+ for the GUI.", "version": "1.7.2", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/ComFreek/chocolatey-packages/883a30663d13abe53a581cefb88b0592b00a5fd8/pympress/icon.png", "author": "Cimbali", "downloadCount": 3576, "tags": ["pdf", "latex", "beamer", "presentation", "projector"]}
