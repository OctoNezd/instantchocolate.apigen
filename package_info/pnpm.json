{"description": "**Background**\n\npnpm uses a content-addressable filesystem to store all files from all module directories on a disk.\nWhen using npm or Yarn, if you have 100 projects using lodash, you will have 100 copies of lodash on disk.\nWith pnpm, lodash will be stored in a content-addressable storage, so:\n\n1. If you depend on different versions of lodash, only the files that differ are added to the store.\n  If lodash has 100 files, and a new version has a change only in one of those files,\n  `pnpm update` will only add 1 new file to the storage.\n1. All the files are saved in a single place on the disk. When packages are installed, their files are linked\n  from that single place consuming no additional disk space. Linking is performed using either hard-links or reflinks (copy-on-write).\n\nAs a result, you save gigabytes of space on your disk and you have a lot faster installations!\nIf you'd like more details about the unique `node_modules` structure that pnpm creates and\nwhy it works fine with the Node.js ecosystem, read this small article: [Flat node_modules is not the only way](https://pnpm.io/blog/2020/05/27/flat-node-modules-is-not-the-only-way).\n\n**Getting Started**\n\n- [Installation](https://pnpm.io/installation)\n- [Usage](https://pnpm.io/pnpm-cli)\n- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://pnpm.io/faq)\n- [Chat](https://r.pnpm.io/chat)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pnpmjs)", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:48:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pnpm/8.15.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pnpm/8.15.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/3a0c77de6e09b317f1fff40099e72f5de85a27a6/LICENSE", "packageName": "pnpm", "displayName": "pnpm", "summary": "Fast, disk space efficient package manager for Node-based projects.", "version": "8.15.1", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/MKMZ/ChocolateyPackages/26ccbb17b8a53910699ba8d9b83592ab8eaab7e2/icons/pnpm.png", "author": "Contributors of pnpm", "downloadCount": 57615, "tags": ["pnpm", "node", "npm"]}
