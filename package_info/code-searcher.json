{"description": "Code Searcher is faster than Windows Explorer, Agent Ransack, File Locator Pro, Directory Opus, PowerDesk Pro or Total Commander. It searches only your source code. It uses multiple processors to find files on disk, perform file matches, and match text. It automatically excludes directories such as packages, node_modules, bower_components. It excludes minified files. Code Searcher has an internal database of valid source code extensions so that it only searches for source code files. Create an index to perform searching as you type.", "updated": "2024-03-07T22:18:23Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/code-searcher/1.16.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/code-searcher/1.16.0.0", "licenseUrl": "http://www.kellermanstores.com/downloads/licensing/code-searcher.rtf", "packageName": "code-searcher", "displayName": "Code Searcher", "summary": "Quickly Search and Index Thousands of Source Code Files.
