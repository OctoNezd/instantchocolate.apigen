{"description": "A compose key allows to easily write special characters such as \u00e9 \u017e \u00e0 \u014d \u00fb \u00f8 \u263a \u00a4 \u2205 \u00ab \u266f \u2e18 \u24c0 \u32b7 \u266a \u266c using short and often very intuitive key combinations. For instance, \u00f6 is obtained using o + \", and \u2665 is obtained using < + 3. I wrote WinCompose because I found none of the alternatives (FreeCompose, CKFW, AllChars or Unichars) to be satisfying.", "updated": "2024-03-22T14:18:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/wincompose/0.9.11", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/wincompose/0.9.11", "licenseUrl": "http://www.wtfpl.net/", "packageName": "wincompose", "displayName": "WinCompose", "summary": "WinCompose - A compose key for Windows", "version": "0.9.11", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/ktos/chocolatey-packages/master/wincompose/wincompose.png", "author": "Sam Hocevar", "downloadCount": 12319, "tags": ["wincompose", "compose", "composekey", "keyboard", "admin"]}
