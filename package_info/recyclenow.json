{"description": "**RecycleNOW is a small utility that, when triggered, immediately empties the Recycle Bin.**\nIt is meant to be a time-saver as, especially on slower computers, emptying the Bin can take a while. There is no interface, just run it and it will automatically empty the recycle bin. You can use a scheduler to run it, run it from the command line etc. Very simple, but may be useful for some.\n\n## Features\n- Fast as lightning\n- There's no visible interface, just an icon\n- Double-click and FLASH! The bin is empty!\n- Runs on Windows 95/98/ME/NT4/2k/2k3/2k8/XP/V/7/10\n\n## Package installation defaults\nBy default, **installation** of this package:\n- Will be installed in Chocolatey tools directory.\n- Will _NOT_ install a desktop icon.\n- Will install a start menu shorcut.\n\n## Package parameters\n- `/InstallDir` - Installation directory, by default Chocolatey tools directory.\n- `/DesktopIcon` - Create a desktop shortcut.\n- `/NoStartMenu` - Do not create a start menu shortcut.\n\n**Example:**\n`choco install recyclenow --params '\"/InstallDir:C:\\your\\install\\path /DesktopIcon /NoStartMenu\"'`\n\nTo have choco remember parameters on upgrade, be sure to set `choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`", "updated": "2024-03-04T04:03:21Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/recyclenow/1.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/recyclenow/1.0.0", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "recyclenow", "displayName": "RecycleNOW - Free Removal Tool", "summary": "RecycleNOW is a small utility that, when triggered, immediately empties the Recycle Bin.", "version": "1.0.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/manual/recyclenow/recyclenow.png", "author": "David De Groot", "downloadCount": 330, "tags": ["recyclenow", "empties", "empty", "recycle", "bin", "utility"]}
