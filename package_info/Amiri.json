{"description": "Amiri is a classical Arabic typeface in Naskh style for typesetting books and\nother running text.\n\nAmiri is a revival of the beautiful typeface pioneered in early 20th century by\n[Bulaq Press](http://www.bibalex.org/bulaqpress/en/bulaq.htm ) in Cairo, also known as Amiria Press, after which the font is\nnamed.\n\nThe uniqueness of this typeface comes from its superb balance between the\nbeauty of Naskh calligraphy on one hand, the constraints and requirements of\nelegant typography on the other. Also, it is one of the few metal typefaces\nthat were used in typesetting the Koran, making it a good source for a digital\ntypeface to be used in typesetting Koranic verses.\n\nAmiri project aims at the revival of the aesthetics and traditions of Arabic\ntypesetting, and adapting it to the era of digital typesetting, in a publicly\navailable form.", "updated": "2024-03-17T18:48:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/Amiri/0.111", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/Amiri/0.111", "licenseUrl": "http://scripts.sil.org/OFL", "packageName": "Amiri", "displayName": "Amiri Font", "summary": "A classical Arabic typeface in Naskh style", "version": "0.111", "icon": "http://www.amirifont.org/banner.jpg", "author": "Khaled Hosny", "downloadCount": 1460, "tags": ["arabic", "font"]}
