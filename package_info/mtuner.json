This gives an unique insight in memory related behavior of your software by making queries over the entire data set.\n\nWhile **MTuner** was created for profiling C/C++ applications, it is possible to profile memory for programs written in other languages as long as there is corresponding debug symbol information. Users can convert DMD CodeView/DWARF debug symbols to PDB format using [cv2pdb](https://github.com/rainers/cv2pdb).\n\n![MTuner screenshot](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/milostosic/MTuner/371e39ed/img/mtuner_screenshot.png)\n\n## MAINTAINER NOTICE:\n\tAnti-virus or anti-malware tools and heuristic engines might inaccurately label this software, due to the application's usage of memory scanning and analyzation.
