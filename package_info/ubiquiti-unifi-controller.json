This package does not have a dependency on a specific Java 11 runtime. Rather, the choice is left up to you as to which runtime you select. One option that has been mentioned in the comments is [Temurin](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/Temurin11jre).\n\nDue to the way this package is generated, package versions prior to 7.3.76 but published after 18-Dec-2022 will also be affected by this change. Consult the release notes for your package to confirm which Java runtime version is required.", "updated": "2024-03-23T21:03:47Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ubiquiti-unifi-controller/8.1.113", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ubiquiti-unifi-controller/8.1.113", "licenseUrl": "https://www.ui.com/eula/", "packageName": "ubiquiti-unifi-controller", "displayName": "Ubiquiti UniFI Controller", "summary": "Ubiquiti device management software", "version": "8.1.113", "icon": "http://raw.githubusercontent.com/flcdrg/chocolatey-ubiquiti/master/icons/ubiquiti.png", "author": "Ubiquiti Networks Inc", "downloadCount": 58845, "tags": ["unifi", "ubiquiti", "wifi", "network", "admin"]}
