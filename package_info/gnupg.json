{"description": "GnuPG itself is a commandline tool without any graphical stuff. It is the real crypto engine which can be used directly from a command prompt, from shell scripts or by other programs. Therefore it can be considered as a backend for other applications.\n\nHowever, even when used on the command line it provides all functionality needed - this includes an interactive menu system. The set of commands of this tool will always be a superset of those provided by any frontends.\n\n## Features\n\n- Full replacement of PGP\n- Does not use any patented algorithms\n- GPLed, written from scratch\n- Can be used as a filter program\n- Full OpenPGP implementation (see RFC4880 at RFC Editor)\n- Better functionality than PGP and some security enhancements over PGP 2\n- Decrypts and verifies PGP 5, 6 and 7 messages\n- Supports ElGamal, DSA, RSA, AES, 3DES, Blowfish, Twofish, CAST5, MD5, SHA-1, RIPE-MD-160 and TIGER\n- Easy implementation of new algorithms using extension modules\n- The User ID is forced to be in a standard format\n- Supports key and signature expiration dates\n- English, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Estonian, French, German, Japanese, Italian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Portuguese (Portuguese), Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish language support\n- Online help system\n- Optional anonymous message receivers\n- Integrated support for HKP keyservers (wwwkeys.pgp.net)\n- Clears signed patch files which can still be processed by patch\n- and many more things\u2026.\n\n## Notes\n\n- This is the modern version of GnuPG (2.2 branch).
