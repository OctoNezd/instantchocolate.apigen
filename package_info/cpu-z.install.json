Automatic updater will release new version with choco fix notation when that happens, but the push of this package can fail due to the longstanding bug with chocolatey gallery.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.rawgit.com/majkinetor/chocolatey/master/cpu-z.install/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/cpu-z.install/2.9.0.20240123", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/cpu-z.install/2.9.0.20240123", "licenseUrl": "http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor-pro/eula.html", "packageName": "cpu-z.install", "displayName": "CPU-Z (Install)", "summary": "System information software", "version": "2.9.0.20240123", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/majkinetor/chocolatey/cpu-z.install/icon.png", "author": "CPUID", "downloadCount": 569271, "tags": ["admin", "system-information", "hardware", "memory", "intel", "amd", "processor", "cpu", "motherboard"]}
