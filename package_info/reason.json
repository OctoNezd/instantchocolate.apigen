{"description": "This is the limited trial version of Reason. You will need a valid Reason account to use the software. Reason emulates a rack of hardware synthesizers, samplers, signal processors, sequencers, and mixers, all of which can be freely interconnected in an arbitrary manner. Reason can be used either as a complete virtual music studio or as a set of virtual instruments to be used with other sequencing software in a fashion that mimics live performance.", "updated": "2024-03-20T11:03:24Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/reason/12.5.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/reason/12.5.1", "licenseUrl": "https://www.reasonstudios.com/agreements#eula", "packageName": "reason", "displayName": "Reason (Install)", "summary": "A digital audio workstation for creating and editing music and audio.", "version": "12.5.1", "icon": "http://cdn.rawgit.com/shiitake/have-some-chocolate/master/Reason/reason-icon.png", "author": "Reason Studios", "downloadCount": 477, "tags": ["reason", "propellerhead"]}
