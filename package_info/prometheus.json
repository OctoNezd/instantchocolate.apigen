{"description": "Prometheus, a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) project, is a systems and service monitoring system. It collects metrics\nfrom configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions,\ndisplays the results, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed\nto be true.\n\nPrometheus' main distinguishing features as compared to other monitoring systems are:\n\n- a **multi-dimensional** data model (timeseries defined by metric name and set of key/value dimensions)\n- a **flexible query language** to leverage this dimensionality\n- no dependency on distributed storage; **single server nodes are autonomous**\n- timeseries collection happens via a **pull model** over HTTP\n- **pushing timeseries** is supported via an intermediary gateway\n- targets are discovered via **service discovery** or **static configuration**\n- multiple modes of **graphing and dashboarding support**\n- support for hierarchical and horizontal **federation**", "updated": "2024-03-22T16:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/prometheus/2.2.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/prometheus/2.2.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "prometheus", "displayName": "Prometheus", "summary": "From metrics to insight", "version": "2.2.1", "icon": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/588945677599780865/mrhc1gSh.png", "author": "Prometheus", "downloadCount": 8317, "tags": ["data", "prometheus", "metric", "monitoring", "admin"]}
