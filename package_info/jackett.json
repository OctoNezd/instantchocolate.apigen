{"description": "Jackett works as a proxy server: it translates queries from apps ([Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr), [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr), [SickRage](https://sickrage.github.io/), [CouchPotato](https://couchpota.to/), [Mylar](https://github.com/evilhero/mylar), etc) into tracker-site-specific http queries, parses the html response, then sends results back to the requesting software. This allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches. Jackett is a single repository of maintained indexer scraping and translation logic - removing the burden from other apps.\n\n## Features\n\n- [Supported Public Trackers](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett/blob/master/README.md#supported-public-trackers)\n- [Supported Semi-Private Trackers](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett/blob/master/README.md#supported-semi-private-trackers)\n- [Supported Private Trackers](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett/blob/master/README.md#supported-private-trackers)\n\n## Notes\n\nInstalls as a service, to get to Jackett open any web browser and go to [localhost]:9117/UI/Dashboard (remove the brackets)\n\n**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package.
