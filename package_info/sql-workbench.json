{"description": "SQL Workbench/J is a free, DBMS-independent, cross-platform SQL query tool. It is written in Java and should run on any operating system that provides a Java Runtime Environment.\n\nIts main focus is on running SQL scripts (either interactively or as a batch) and export/import features. Graphical query building or more advanced DBA tasks are not the focus and are not planned.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Edit, insert and delete data directly in the [query result](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/MainWindow_png.html) ([Screenshot](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/EditData_png.html))\n* Powerful [export command](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/manual/command-export.html) to write text files (aka \"CSV\"), XML, HTML or SQL (including BLOB data). All user tables can be exported into a directory with a single command. Export files can be compressed \"on-the-fly\".\n* Powerful text, XML and spreadsheet [import](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/manual/command-import.html). A set of files (including compressed files) can be imported from a directory with a single * command. Foreign key constraints are detected to insert the data in the correct order\n* [Compare](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/manual/compare-commands.html#command-schema-diff) two database schemas for differences. The XML output can be transformed into the approriate SQL ALTER statements using [XSLT](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/xslt.html)\n* [Compare the data](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/manual/compare-commands.html#command-data-diff) of two database and generate the necessary SQL statements to migrate one to the other.\n* Supports running SQL scripts in [batch mode](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/manual/using-scripting.html)\n* Supports running in [console mode](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/manual/console-mode.html) ([Screenshot](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/console_png.html))\n* Search text in procedure, view and other sources using a [SQL command](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/manual/wb-commands.html#command-search-source) or a GUI ([Screenshot 1](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/objectsearcher_png.html) [Screenshot 2](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/wbgrepsource_png.html))\n* Search for data across all columns in all tables using a [SQL command](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/manual/wb-commands.html#command-search-data) or a GUI ([Screenshot 1](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/SearchTables_png.html) [Screenshot 2](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/parent_rows_png.html))\n* Reformatting (Pretty-Print) of SQL Statements ([Screenshot](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/SqlFormat_png.html))\n* Select rows from related tables according to their foreign key definitions ([Screenshot 1](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/child_rows_png.html) [Screenshot 2](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/parent_rows_png.html)).\n* Tooltips for INSERT statements to show the corresponding value or column ([Screenshot](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/insert_hint_png.html))\n* Copy data directly between to database servers using a [SQL command](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/manual/command-copy.html) or a GUI ([Screenshot](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/DataPumper_png.html))\n* [Macros](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/manual/using.html#macros) (aka aliases) for frequently used SQL statements\n* Variable substitution in SQL statements including smart prompting for values (can be combined with macros)\n* Auto completion for tables and columns in SQL statements ([Screenshot](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/completion_png.html))\n* Display database objects and their definitions ([Screenshot](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/table_definition_png.html))\n* Display table source ([Screenshot](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/TableSource_png.html))\n* Display view, procedure and trigger source code ([Screenshot](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/ViewSource_png.html))\n* Display foreign key constraints between tables ([Screenshot](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/FkDisplay_png.html))\n\nFor more information, see [https://www.sql-workbench.eu/](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/).", "updated": "2024-03-20T22:48:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sql-workbench/127.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/sql-workbench/127.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.sql-workbench.eu/manual/license.html", "packageName": "sql-workbench", "displayName": "SQL Workbench/J", "summary": "SQL Workbench/J is a free, DBMS-independent, cross-platform SQL query tool.", "version": "127.0.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/burck1/au-packages@master/sql-workbench/icons/sql-workbench.png", "author": "Thomas Kellerer", "downloadCount": 3820, "tags": ["sql", "workbench", "java"]}
