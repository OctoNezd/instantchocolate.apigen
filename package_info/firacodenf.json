{"description": "# FiraCodeNF\n\nNerd Fonts patches developer targeted fonts with a high number of glyphs\n(icons). Specifically to add a high number of extra glyphs from popular\n'iconic fonts' such as\n[Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome),\n[Devicons](https://vorillaz.github.io/devicons/),\n[Octicons](https://github.com/primer/octicons), and\n[others](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#glyph-sets).\n\n## Fira Code: free monospaced font with programming ligatures\n\n![Fira Code](./extras/logo.svg)\n\n### Problem\n\nProgrammers use a lot of symbols, often encoded with several characters. For the human brain, sequences like `->`, `<=` or `:=` are single logical tokens, even if they take two or three characters on the screen. Your eye spends a non-zero amount of energy to scan, parse and join multiple characters into a single logical one. Ideally, all programming languages should be designed with full-fledged Unicode symbols for operators, but that\u2019s not the case yet.\n\n### Solution\n\nFira Code is a free monospaced font containing ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations. This is just a font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. This helps to read and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences like `..` or `//`, ligatures allow us to correct spacing.\n\n### Download & Install\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases/download/6.2/Fira_Code_v6.2.zip\"><img alt=\"Fira_Code_v6.2.zip - December 6, 2021 - 2.5 MB\" src=\"./extras/download.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"130\"></a>\n\nThen:\n\n- [How to Install](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki)\n- [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki#troubleshooting)\n- [News & Updates](https://twitter.com/FiraCode)\n\n### Support\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/tonsky\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Sponsor\" src=\"./extras/sponsor.png\"></a>\n\nFira Code is a personal, free-time project with no funding and a huge [feature request backlog](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/issues). If you love it, consider supporting its development via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tonsky) or [Patreon](https://patreon.com/tonsky). Any help counts!\n\n### What\u2019s in the box?\n\nLeft: ligatures as rendered in Fira Code. Right: same character sequences without ligatures.\n\n<img src=\"./extras/ligatures.png\" width=\"754\" height=\"1326\">\n\nFira Code comes with a huge variety of arrows. Even better: you can make them as long as you like and combine start/middle/end fragments however you want!\n\n<img src=\"./extras/arrows.png\" width=\"754\" height=\"799\">\n\nFira Code is not only about ligatures. Some fine-tuning is done for punctuation and frequent letter pairs.\n\n<img src=\"./extras/typographics.png\" width=\"754\" height=\"649\">\n\nFira Code comes with a few different character variants, so that everyone can choose what\u2019s best for them.
