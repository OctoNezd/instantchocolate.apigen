{"description": "Anonymous Pro is a family of four fixed-width fonts designed especially with coding in mind. Characters that could be mistaken for one another (O, 0, I, l, 1, etc.) have distinct shapes to make them easier to tell apart in the context of source code.\n\nAnonymous Pro also features an international, Unicode-based character set, with support for most Western and European Latin-based languages, Greek, and Cyrillic. It also includes special \"box drawing\" characters for those who need them.", "updated": "2024-03-18T11:48:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/AnonymousPro/2014.12.31", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/AnonymousPro/2014.12.31", "licenseUrl": "http://scripts.sil.org/OFL", "packageName": "AnonymousPro", "displayName": "Anonymous Pro", "summary": "", "version": "2014.12.31", "icon": "", "author": "Mark Simonson", "downloadCount": 4237, "tags": ["font", "monospace", "anonymousPro", "mono", "fixedWidth", "fixed"]}
