{"description": "Hindsight is a free tool for analyzing web artifacts. It started with the browsing \nhistory of the Google Chrome web browser and has expanded to support other Chromium-based \napplications (with more to come!). Hindsight can parse a number of different types of web \nartifacts, including URLs, download history, cache records, bookmarks, autofill records, \nsaved passwords, preferences, browser extensions, HTTP cookies, and Local Storage records \n(HTML5 cookies). Once the data is extracted from each file, it is correlated with data \nfrom other history files and placed in a timeline.", "updated": "2024-03-22T17:48:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/hindsight/2023.03", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/hindsight/2023.03", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/obsidianforensics/hindsight/blob/master/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "hindsight", "displayName": "Hindsight", "summary": "Web browser forensics for Google Chrome/Chromium", "version": "2023.03", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/sustainablelobster/dfir-chocolatey-packages/7a990a7ec2ed2529736a724b68638b0a434fb939/icons/hindsight.png", "author": "Obsidian Forensics,  Ryan Benson", "downloadCount": 248, "tags": ["hindsight", "chrome", "browser", "forensics", "dfir"]}
