{"description": "mSIGNA\u2122 offers both secure enterprise-level solutions and straightforward single-user account management. It is the successor to CoinVault\u2122, the first bitcoin wallet supporting shared multisignature account policies using deterministic keychains. Generate private keychains offline, safely share public keychains, and create joint accounts with m-of-n signature policies. Export private keychains or print them for secure backup.\n\nmSIGNA is an interactive desktop application for transacting on the bitcoin network supporting m-of-n signature policies and multiuser/multidevice account management. While the current release builds only support bitcoin, it is possible to compile it to support other bitcoin-like blockchain-based cryptocurrencies.\n\nmSIGNA is built atop, three custom libraries, CoinCore, CoinQ, and CoinDB, which provide all core functionality for managing bitcoin data structures, connecting to peers, and handling persistent storage.\n\n* CoinCore is licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\n* CoinQ and CoinDB are licensed under the [AGPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html).", "updated": "2024-03-16T02:33:52Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/msigna/0.10.5", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/msigna/0.10.5", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ciphrex/CoinVault/master/docs/eula.txt", "packageName": "msigna", "displayName": "mSIGNA", "summary": "Secure CryptoCoin Storage and Account Management", "version": "0.10.5", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/ciphrex/CoinVault/4e4f47d84582ffd29c9e8d1996d508e679e6d608/res/icons/app_icons/256x256.png", "author": "Ciphrex Corporation", "downloadCount": 3165, "tags": ["bitcoin", "btc", "blockchain", "wallet", "cryptocurrency", "admin"]}
