{"description": "aacgain normalizes the volume of digital music files using the\n    Replay Gain algorithm. It works by modifying the global_gain fields in the\n    aac samples. Free-form metadata tags are added to the file to save undo\n    information, making the normalization process reversable.\n    http://github.com/svnpenn/p/tree/master/aacgain", "updated": "2024-03-20T21:33:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/aacgain/1.9.0.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/aacgain/1.9.0.2", "licenseUrl": "http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0", "packageName": "aacgain", "displayName": "AACGain", "summary": "", "version": "1.9.0.2", "icon": "http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/images/mp3gainlogosmall.gif", "author": "David Lasker", "downloadCount": 2320, "tags": ["audio"]}
