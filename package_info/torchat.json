TorChat is all you need. Built on the anonymity providing Tor network, TorChat is a P2P chat messenger primarily focused on the privacy of the user communication. The application is completely portable, and can be run without requiring any initial configuration. Since TorChat uses Tor network\u2019s anonymizing services, it\u2019s impossible to find out the location of the user. Not only that, sender and receiver information is protected, and the communications are encrypted end-to-end as well. TorChat assigns a unique alphanumeric ID to each user, and you can add other users to your contact list via this unique IDs. Support for file transfer is there as well.\n\nPlease note that TorChat is produced independently from the Tor\u00ae anonymity software, I am not related with or sponsored by torproject.org. TorChat is making use of the Tor\u00ae client software and the Windows version comes bundled with original Tor binaries but TorChat itself is a completely separate project developed by totally different people\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/torchat/readme.md)**", "updated": "2024-03-17T19:03:23Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/torchat/0.9.9.553201803", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/torchat/0.9.9.553201803", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "torchat", "displayName": "TorChat (Portable)", "summary": "Decentralized anonymous instant messenger on top of Tor Hidden Services", "version": "0.9.9.553201803", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prof7bit/TorChat/torchat2/bin/icons/torchat.png", "author": "prof7bit", "downloadCount": 1351, "tags": ["torchat", "torchat2", "im", "chat", "messenger", "portable"]}
