{"description": "HWMonitor is a hardware monitoring program that reads PC systems main health sensors : voltages, temperatures, fans speed.\n\nThe program handles the most common sensor chips, like ITE\u00ae IT87 series, most Winbond\u00ae ICs, and others. In addition, it can read modern CPUs on-die core thermal sensors, as well has hard drives temperature via S.M.A.R.T, and video card GPU temperature.\n\nSpecial hardware monitors such as abit\u00ae uGuru and Gigabyte\u00ae ODIN\u2122 power supplies serie are supported too.", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:33:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/hwmonitor/1.53.0.20240220", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/hwmonitor/1.53.0.20240220", "licenseUrl": "http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor-pro/eula.html", "packageName": "hwmonitor", "displayName": "HWMonitor", "summary": "HWMonitor is a hardware monitoring program that reads PC systems main health sensors : voltages, temperatures, fans speed.", "version": "1.53.0.20240220", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ionred/chocolatey-packages/master/icons/hwmonitor_icon.PNG", "author": "CPUID", "downloadCount": 196137, "tags": ["admin", "hardware", "monitoring", "temperature", "sensor", "fan-speed", "heath", "thermal", "hard-drive", "smart", "gpu", "temps"]}
