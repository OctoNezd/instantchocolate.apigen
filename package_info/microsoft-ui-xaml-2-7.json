WinUI 2 can be used in any Windows 10 UWP XAML app, or in a Xamarin.Forms app running on Windows 10 using native view embedding.\n\nWinUI 3 is the next generation of the WinUI framework. It dramatically expands WinUI into a full UX framework, making WinUI available for all types of Windows apps - from Win32 to UWP - for use as the UI layer.\n\n**NOTE**: The version of this package and the version of the AppX package installed, do not match (for example, version '2.7.0' is actually AppX package version '7.2109.13004.0')\n**NOTE**: This is a manually updated package.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/microsoft-ui-xaml-2-7/2.7.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/microsoft-ui-xaml-2-7/2.7.3", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/main/LICENSE", "packageName": "microsoft-ui-xaml-2-7", "displayName": "Microsoft.UI.Xaml 2.7 (Install)", "summary": "WinUI is a user interface layer that contains modern controls and styles for building Windows apps.
