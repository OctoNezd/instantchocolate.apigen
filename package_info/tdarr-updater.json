For example, you can set rules for the required codecs, containers, languages etc that your media should have which helps keeps things organized and can increase compatability with your devices. A common use for Tdarr is to simply convert video files from h264 to h265 (hevc), saving 40%-50% in size.\n\nThe application is in the form of a click-to-run web-app, comprised of the following 2 components:\n\n* Tdarr_Server - Central process which all Nodes connect with\n* Tdarr_Node - Processes running on same/other devices which collect tasks from the Server\n\nPut your spare hardware to use with Tdarr Nodes for Windows, Linux (including Linux arm/arm64) and macOS.\n\nDesigned to work alongside applications like Sonarr/Radarr and built with the aim of modularisation, parallelisation and scalability, each library you add has its own transcode settings, filters and schedule. Workers can be fired up and closed down as necessary, and are split into 4 types - Transcode CPU/GPU and Health Check CPU/GPU. Worker limits can be managed by the scheduler as well as manually.
