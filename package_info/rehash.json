{"description": "ReHash is an easy-to-use console-based hash calculation tool written in C++. It supports many algorithms and output formats and it can be fully configured using some of the many command-line arguments which can be passed to the tool.\n\nThe tool is compilable under Windows and Linux.\n\nIt supports many algorithms, for example Adler32, CRC-16, CRC-16-CCITT, CRC-16-XMODEM, CRC-32, ELF-32, FCS-16, FCS-32, FNV-32, FNV-64, GHash-32-3, GHash-32-5, GOST-Hash, HAVAL (3/4/5, 256), MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, Size64, Tiger, XUM32. For a full list see the ReHash documentation manual (included in downloadable package).\n\nIt is possible to compute the HMACs of all algorithms.\n\nThe tool can output the hashes in various formats like plain text, HTML, XML and CSV.\n\nReHash can be fully configured using some of the many command-line arguments which can be passed to the tool. You can selectively activate/disable hash algorithms and set scanning options like scanning subdirectories recursively and excluding/including files using advanced file pattern matching.\n\n[Manual](http://rehash.sourceforge.net/rehash.html)\n\nSource code: http://sourceforge.net/projects/rehash/files/rehash/0.2/rehash-0.2-src.zip/download", "updated": "2024-03-23T11:48:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rehash/0.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/rehash/0.2", "licenseUrl": "http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php", "packageName": "rehash", "displayName": "ReHash", "summary": "Console hash calculator", "version": "0.2", "icon": "", "author": "Dominik Reichl", "downloadCount": 1002, "tags": ["cli", "checksum"]}
