{"description": "# Buildozer\n\nBuildozer is a command line tool to rewrite multiple\n[Bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel) BUILD files using\nstandard commands.\n\n## Usage\n\n```shell\nbuildozer [OPTIONS] ['command args' | -f FILE ] label-list\n```\n\nHere, `label-list` is a space-separated list of Bazel labels, for example\n`//path/to/pkg1:rule1 //path/to/pkg2:rule2`.\n\nWhen `-f FILE` is used, buildozer reads commands from `FILE` (`-` for stdin).\nFormat: lines of `|`-separated sets of commands and labels (`command args|label|label...`).\nWhen the label is a single '*', then the command will be applied to all\nelements of label-list from the command line.\n\nYou should specify at least one command and one target. Buildozer will execute\nall commands on all targets. Commands are executed in order, files are processed\nin parallel.\n\n### Targets\n\nTargets look like Bazel labels, but there can be some differences in presence of\nmacros.\n\n  * Use the label notation to refer to a rule: `//buildtools/buildozer:edit`\n  * Use the `__pkg__` suffix to refer to the package declaration:\n   `//buildtools/buildozer:__pkg__`\n  * Use an asterisk to refer to all rules in a file: `//pkg:*`\n  * Use `...` to refer to all descendant BUILD files in a directory: `//pkg/...:*`\n  * Use percent to refer to all rules of a certain kind: `//pkg:%java_library`\n  * Use percent-and-number to refer to a rule that begins at a certain line:\n   `//pkg:%123`.\n  * Use `-` for the package name if you want to process standard input stream\n   instead of a file: `-:all_tests`.", "updated": "2024-03-21T21:18:50Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/buildozer/6.1.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/buildozer/6.1.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "buildozer", "displayName": "Buildozer", "summary": "Buildozer is a command line tool to rewrite multiple Bazel BUILD files using standard commands.", "version": "6.1.1", "icon": "", "author": "bazelbuild", "downloadCount": 1766, "tags": ["buildtools", "bazel", "build", "buildozer"]}
