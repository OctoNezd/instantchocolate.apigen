This allows games, programs and other folders to be compressed transparently (i.e they can still be used normally) with no performance loss. \n\nThis is similar to the NTFS-LZNT1 compression built-in to Windows (Right click > Properties > Compress to save space) however the newer algorithms that CompactGUI use were introduced in Windows 10 and are much more efficient, multi-threaded, and designed for use on executable programs resulting in greater compression ratios with almost no performance impact. [More information can be found here](https://github.com/ImminentFate/CompactGUI)\n\n####Main Uses\n* Reduce the size of games (e.g. Fortnite: 18.8GB > 10.2GB)\n* Reduce the size of programs (e.g. Adobe Photoshop: 1.71GB > 886MB)\n* Compress any other folder on your computer\n\n###Additional Features\n* Visual feedback on compression progress and statistics\n* Online integration with community-sourced database to get compression estimates and analyses\n* Integration into Windows Explorer context menus for easier use. \n* Drag-and drop functionality\n* Shutdown/Restart/Sleep on completion\n\n![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/JPYB7Z4.png)\n\n**[More Information can be found on the GitHub project page](https://github.com/ImminentFate/CompactGUI)**\n\nCompactGUI will be installed standalone in the default Chocolatey package directory", "updated": "2024-03-22T22:03:51Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/compactgui/2.6.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/compactgui/2.6.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/ImminentFate/CompactGUI/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "compactgui", "displayName": "CompactGUI", "summary": "CompactGUI - easily compress games, programs and other folders transparently", "version": "2.6.2", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImminentFate/CompactGUI/master/icon.png", "author": "ImminentFate", "downloadCount": 9816, "tags": ["compact", "compactgui", "compact-gui", "compact_gui"]}
