{"description": "Gmsh is an open source 3D finite element mesh generator with a built-in CAD engine and post-processor.\n\nIts design goal is to provide a fast, light and user-friendly meshing tool with parametric input and advanced visualization capabilities.  \nGmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and post-processing.\n\nThe specification of any input to these modules is done either interactively using the graphical user interface, in ASCII text files using Gmsh's own scripting language (.geo files), or using the C++, C, Python or Julia Application Programming Interface (API).", "updated": "2024-03-18T09:48:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gmsh/4.12.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/gmsh/4.12.1", "licenseUrl": "https://gmsh.info/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "gmsh", "displayName": "Gmsh", "summary": "A three-dimensional finite element mesh generator with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities", "version": "4.12.1", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/usm-community/chocolatey-packages@master/icons/gmsh.png", "author": "Christophe Geuzaine,  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Remacle", "downloadCount": 1650, "tags": ["gmsh", "finite", "element", "mesh", "solver"]}
