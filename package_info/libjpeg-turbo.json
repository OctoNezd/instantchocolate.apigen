{"description": "libjpeg-turbo is a derivative of libjpeg that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, and ARM systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-4x as fast as the unmodified version of libjpeg, all else being equal.\n\nlibjpeg-turbo was originally based on libjpeg/SIMD by Miyasaka Masaru, but the TigerVNC and VirtualGL projects made numerous enhancements to the codec in 2009, including improved support for Mac OS X, 64-bit support, support for 32-bit and big-endian pixel formats (RGBX, XBGR, etc.), accelerated Huffman encoding/decoding, and various bug fixes. The goal was to produce a fully open-source codec that could replace the partially closed-source TurboJPEG/IPP codec used by VirtualGL and TurboVNC. libjpeg-turbo generally achieves 80-120% of the performance of TurboJPEG/IPP. It is faster in some areas but slower in others.", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:33:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/libjpeg-turbo/1.2.1.201304081", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/libjpeg-turbo/1.2.1.201304081", "licenseUrl": "http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php", "packageName": "libjpeg-turbo", "displayName": "libjpeg-turbo", "summary": "libjpeg-turbo is a derivative of libjpeg that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, and ARM systems.
