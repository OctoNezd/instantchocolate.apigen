{"description": "scans any kind of input (disk images, files, directories of files, etc)\nand extracts structured information such as email addresses, credit card numbers,\nJPEGs and JSON snippets without parsing the file\nsystem or file system structures. The results are stored in text files that are easily\ninspected, searched, or used as inputs for other forensic processing. bulk_extractor also creates\nhistograms of certain kinds of features that it finds, such as Google search terms and email addresses,\nas previous research has shown that such histograms are especially useful in investigative and law enforcement applications.\n\nUnlike other digital forensics tools, `bulk_extractor` probes every byte of data to see if it is the start of a\nsequence that can be decompressed or otherwise decoded. If so, the\ndecoded data are recursively re-examined. As a result, `bulk_extractor` can find things like BASE64-encoded JPEGs and\ncompressed JSON objects that traditional carving tools miss.", "updated": "2024-03-21T06:48:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/bulk-extractor/1.5.5", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/bulk-extractor/1.5.5", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor/blob/main/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "bulk-extractor", "displayName": "bulk_extractor", "summary": "bulk_extractor is a high-performance digital forensics exploitation tool.", "version": "1.5.5", "icon": "", "author": "Simson Garfinkel", "downloadCount": 219, "tags": ["bulk-extractor", "bulk_extractor", "forensics", "dfir"]}
