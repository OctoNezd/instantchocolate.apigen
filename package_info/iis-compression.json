{"description": "**IIS Compression** is a bundle of two IIS compression scheme providers `iisbrotli.dll` and `iiszlib.dll` that enable IIS to compress HTTP response contents. `iisbrotli.dll` supports **Brotli** compression, while `iiszlib.dll` supports both **Gzip** and **Deflate** compression.\n\n\t\t\tAn IIS compression scheme provider is a pluggable extension of IIS `StaticCompressionModule` and `DynamicCompressionModule` - essentially a dynamic link library (dll) that implements the compression algorithm and exposes the [IIS HTTP Compression API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd692872.aspx). IIS `StaticCompressionModule` and `DynamicCompressionModule` load the registered compression scheme providers into worker process at runtime, and leverage them to perform compression for static files and dynamically-generated contents, respectively.", "updated": "2024-03-21T20:18:48Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/iis-compression/1.0.6502", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/iis-compression/1.0.6502", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/microsoft/IIS.Compression/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "iis-compression", "displayName": "iis-compression (Install)", "summary": "IIS Compression is a bundle of two IIS compression scheme providers iisbrotli.dll and iiszlib.dll that enable IIS to compress HTTP response contents. iisbrotli.dll supports Brotli compression, while iiszlib.dll supports both Gzip and Deflate compression.", "version": "1.0.6502", "icon": "https://www.iis.net/favicon.ico", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 986, "tags": ["iis-compression", "iis"]}
