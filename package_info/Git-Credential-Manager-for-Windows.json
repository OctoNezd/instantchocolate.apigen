{"description": "The Git Credential Manager for Windows (GCM) provides secure Git credential storage for Windows. It's the successor to the Windows Credential Store for Git (git-credential-winstore), which is no longer maintained. Compared to Git's built-in credential storage for Windows (wincred), which provides single-factor authentication support working on any HTTP enabled Git repository, GCM provides multi-factor authentication support for Visual Studio Team Services, Team Foundation Server, and GitHub.\n\nThis project includes:\n\n* Secure password storage in the Windows Credential Store\n* Multi-factor authentication support for Visual Studio Team Services\n* Two-factor authentication support for GitHub\n* Personal Access Token generation and usage support for Visual Studio Team Services and GitHub\n* Non-interactive mode support for Visual Studio Team Services backed by Azure Directory\n* Kerberos authentication for Team Foundation Server (see notes)\n* Optional settings for build agent optimization\n\n**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:18:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/1.20.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/1.20.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/blob/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows", "displayName": "Git Credential Manager for Windows", "summary": "Secure Git credential storage for Windows.", "version": "1.20.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pauby/ChocoPackages@69f57827/icons/git-credential-manager-for-windows.png", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 237399, "tags": ["git", "github", "credential", "secure"]}
