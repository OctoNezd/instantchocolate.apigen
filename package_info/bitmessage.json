{"description": "Bitmessage is decentralized and trustless, meaning that you need-not inherently trust any entities like root certificate authorities. It uses strong authentication which means that the sender of a message cannot be spoofed, and it aims to hide \"non-content\" data, like the sender and receiver of messages, from passive eavesdroppers like those running warrantless wiretapping programs.\n\n[Community support forum](https://bitmessage.org/forum/)\n[Frequently Asked Questions](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/FAQ)\n[Source code repository](https://github.com/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage)", "updated": "2024-03-15T21:04:05Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/bitmessage/0.6.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/bitmessage/0.6.1", "licenseUrl": "http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php", "packageName": "bitmessage", "displayName": "Bitmessage", "summary": "P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted messages to another person or to many subscribers", "version": "0.6.1", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/7360d0d0c008f92e6ae5c5f2e8fcb3a09d0772ef/icons/bitmessage.svg", "author": "Jonathan Warren", "downloadCount": 2319, "tags": ["encryption", "p2p", "privacy", "communications"]}
