{"description": "## Features:\n\n    * Buying buildings with one click?\n    * Upgrade units with one click if you have resources\n    * Last saved file is put on top of \"Load\" list (files are sorted by time, not name)\n    * An installer that will also download the Heroes 2 Demo or extra maps to not look for them how to copy (only on Windows now)\n    * Quick combat to avoid tedious battles. If the QuickCombat results are not perfect, you can replay the battle\n    * Performance improvements over Free Heroes 2. Especially when \"end-turn\", in my testing is around 3-4 times quicker\n    * Many UI fixes\n    * Game balance fixes: going to a boat will not drain all movement points (but it will dran many). This matches more with Heroes 6-7 gameplay, but is nicer like this. The same is with digging for treasures", "updated": "2024-03-09T17:33:17Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/fheroes2enh/1.1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/fheroes2enh/1.1.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/ciplogic/fheroes2enh/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "fheroes2enh", "displayName": "fheroes2enh (Install)", "summary": "Free Heroes 2 is an engine recreation of game Heroes 2 (of Might and Magic) with UI and coding enhancements.", "version": "1.1.0", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/img/icons.iconarchive.com/icons/3xhumed/mega-games-pack-28/256/Heroes-II-of-Might-and-Magic-2-icon.png", "author": "ciplogic", "downloadCount": 367, "tags": ["fheroes2enh", "homm2", "heroes", "of", "might", "and", "magic", "2"]}
