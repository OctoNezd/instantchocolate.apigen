{"description": "## Gifsicle\nGifsicle is a command-line tool for creating, editing, and getting information about GIF images and animations. Making a GIF animation with gifsicle is easy:\n\n```\ngifsicle --delay=10 --loop *.gif > anim.gif\n```\nExtracting frames from animations is easy too:\n```\ngifsicle anim.gif '#0' > firstframe.gif\n```\nYou can also edit animations by replacing, deleting, or inserting frames:\n```\ngifsicle -b anim.gif --replace '#0' new.gif\n```\nSome more gifsicle features:\n\nBatch mode for changing GIFs in place.\nPrints detailed information about GIFs, including comments.\nControl over interlacing, comments, looping, transparency...\nCreates well-behaved GIFs: removes redundant colors, only uses local color tables if it absolutely has to (local color tables waste space and can cause viewing artifacts), etc.\nIt can shrink colormaps and change images to use the Web-safe palette (or any colormap you choose).\nOptimize your animations! This stores only the changed portion of each frame, and can radically shrink your GIFs. You can also use transparency to make them even smaller. Gifsicle\u2019s optimizer is pretty powerful, and usually reduces animations to within a couple bytes of the best commercial optimizers.\nUnoptimizing animations, which makes them easier to edit.\nA dumb name.\n\n### Package-specific issue\nIf this package isn't up-to-date for some days, [Create an issue](https://github.com/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages/issues/new/choose)\n\nSupport the package maintainer and [![Patreon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@d15c4e19c709e7148588d4523ffc6dd3cd3c7e5e/icons/patreon.png)](https://www.patreon.com/tunisiano)", "updated": "2024-03-23T18:33:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gifsicle/1.95.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/gifsicle/1.95.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/kohler/gifsicle/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "gifsicle", "displayName": "gifsicle (Install)", "summary": "...", "version": "1.95.0", "icon": "", "author": "Eddie Kohler", "downloadCount": 3908, "tags": ["gifsicle", "gif"]}
