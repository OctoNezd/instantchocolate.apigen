{"description": "Inter is a typeface carefully crafted and designed for computer screens. Inter features a tall x-height to aid in readability of mixed-case and lower-case text. Inter is a variable font with several OpenType features, like contextual alternates that adjusts punctuation depending on the shape of surrounding glyphs, slashed zero for when you need to disambiguate \"0\" from \"o\", tabular numbers, etc.\n\nInter can be classified as a geometric neo-grotesque, similar in style to Roboto, Apple San Francisco, Akkurat, Asap, Lucida Grande and more. Some trade-offs were made in order to make this typeface work really well at small sizes.\n\n![Sample](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rsms/inter@e614a1c40f7151ba7eaa9ccb200738bcd8076f77/misc/readme/intro.png)", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:48:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/inter/4.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/inter/4.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/rsms/inter/blob/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "inter", "displayName": "Inter Font", "summary": "The Inter font family", "version": "4.0.0", "icon": "", "author": "The Inter UI Project Authors,  Rasmus Andersson", "downloadCount": 1040, "tags": ["inter", "font", "text", "ttc", "ttf", "FOSS", "embedded"]}
