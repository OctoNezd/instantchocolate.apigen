However, this application was not designed for global execution. Therefore, you may experience issues when launching the GUI or using the command-line interface via the shim. Users requiring this functionality should pass the `--shimgen-usetargetworkingdirectory` switch for the application to run correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-06T21:03:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rweverything.portable/1.7.0.20220602", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/rweverything.portable/1.7.0.20220602", "licenseUrl": "http://rweverything.com/", "packageName": "rweverything.portable", "displayName": "RWEverything (Portable)", "summary": "Read & Write Everything", "version": "1.7.0.20220602", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/brogers5/chocolatey-package-rweverything.portable@a17d2d8f04410806c68a9ff8e032d7df79faed72/rweverything.portable.png", "author": "Jeff Chan", "downloadCount": 208, "tags": ["rweverything", "pci", "memory", "index", "io", "space", "data", "sio", "clock", "dimm", "spd", "smbus", "msr", "register", "ata", "atapi", "acpi", "disk", "usb", "smbios", "edid", "freeware", "cli"]}
