{"description": "Fira Code is an extension of the Fira Mono font containing a set of ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations.\n      This is just a font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible.\n      This helps to read and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences like .. or //, ligatures allow us to correct spacing.\n\n      Note: please close all applications that are using FiraCode (eg. vscode) before upgrade.", "updated": "2024-03-23T23:03:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/FiraCode/6.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/FiraCode/6.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "FiraCode", "displayName": "Fira Code Font", "summary": "Monospaced font with programming ligatures", "version": "6.2", "icon": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/968487958801248257/lfqLESLY_400x400.jpg", "author": "Nikita Prokopov", "downloadCount": 189677, "tags": ["monospace", "opentype", "ligatures", "programming", "font", "admin"]}
