{"description": "In Windows, you can use Windows Firewall to block or unblock certain applications, but it doesn\u2019t offer an easy-to-use interface for its advanced features. If you want to block an application from accessing\nthe internet, you must go through the following steps:\n\n1. Click the Windows Start Menu and open Control Panel\n2. Select System and Security\n3. Then in the Firewall section, you select \u201cAllow a program through the Windows Firewall\u201d\n4. If the program you wish to block or unblock isn\u2019t listed, you must click \u201cAllow another program\u201d to add it. Choose the application in the list and select \u201cAdd\u201d. Else you must then browse the hard drive to find it, and so on. This seems complicated for the average user.\n\nFirewall App Blocker makes the process very easy! Simply drag and drop the application you wish to block into the FAB window, or browse the hard disk to find it. That\u2019s it! If you want to allow it access again, you need only select it and press the Delete button.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.rawgit.com/majkinetor/chocolatey/master/fab/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-22T11:33:39Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/fab/1.9", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/fab/1.9", "licenseUrl": "http://www.sordum.org/eula", "packageName": "fab", "displayName": "Firewall App Blocker", "summary": "Quickly block apps using Windows Firewall", "version": "1.9", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/majkinetor/chocolatey/fab/icon.png", "author": "Velociraptor", "downloadCount": 5789, "tags": ["network", "firewall", "freeware"]}
