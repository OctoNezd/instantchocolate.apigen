{"description": "#Terminal emulator and SSH client.\n\nSecure Shell is an xterm-compatible terminal emulator and stand-alone ssh client for Chrome.  It uses Native-Client to connect directly to ssh servers without the need for external proxies.\n\nIf you are using Chrome OS, this is the App version for you.  All other platforms should use the extension version instead.\n\nIt has been well tested for a couple of years.\t\n\t\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/secureshell-chrome/readme.md)**", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:33:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/secureshell-chrome/0.8.43", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/secureshell-chrome/0.8.43", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "secureshell-chrome", "displayName": "Secure Shell Extension for Chrome", "summary": "Secure Shell (nassh) is a Chrome App that combines hterm with a NaCl build of OpenSSH to provide a PuTTY-like app for Chrome users.", "version": "0.8.43", "icon": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XtlVAe4r7K3jWFFhqHuUe6ZVhUk-YjIqxge2wYqMfmk9pIo9LfHOZVpH9XmVA61f3GAXOUY5", "author": "chrome-secure-shell-publishers", "downloadCount": 805, "tags": ["secure", "shell", "ssh", "terminal", "emulator", "chrome", "extension"]}
