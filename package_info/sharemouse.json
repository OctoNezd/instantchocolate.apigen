Any mouse and keyboard input is transmitted to the corresponding computer.\nSimilar to a network KVM, ShareMouse transmits mouse movements and clicks through the local LAN. All traffic can be password-protected and AES encrypted.\nTo switch between computers, there is no additional hardware or press of a button required.\nSimilar to a keyboard switch, you can seamlessly operate multiple computers on your desk from any mouse and keyboard.", "updated": "2024-03-22T13:18:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sharemouse/5.0.29", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/sharemouse/5.0.29", "licenseUrl": "https://www.bartelsmedia.com/terms/", "packageName": "sharemouse", "displayName": "ShareMouse", "summary": "The software \"ShareMouse\" lets you control multiple computers from a single mouse and keyboard.", "version": "5.0.29", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/Elderry/chocolatey-packages/3a126dadde61c6f6aa982809d6e499ed57b91b75/icons/sharemouse.png", "author": "Bartels Media GmbH", "downloadCount": 7621, "tags": ["trial", "mouse", "share", "admin"]}
