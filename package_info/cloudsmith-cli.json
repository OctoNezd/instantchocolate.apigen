{"description": "The [Cloudsmith Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/cloudsmith-io/cloudsmith-cli) is a text-based interface to the [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.com) API.\nThis allows users, machines and other services to access and integrate smoothly with Cloudsmith without requiring explicit plugins or tools.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Once this package is installed, the 'cloudsmith' commands MAY NOT work until you close and re-open your PowerShell console,\nor until you run a 'refreshenv' command. This only happens on first-run.\n\nCurrently, this chocolatey package takes a simple dependency on `python`, so be forewarned that the latest available python package (python3) will be installed.\nAlso, since the underlying install command uses `pip`, and pip is often out-of-date in the latest python package, pip will also be ugraded before the target package install.\nWe plan to support more advanced customizations in a future build.", "updated": "2024-03-22T15:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/cloudsmith-cli/0.32.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/cloudsmith-cli/0.32.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/cloudsmith-io/cloudsmith-cli/blob/master/LICENSE/", "packageName": "cloudsmith-cli", "displayName": "cloudsmith-cli (Install)", "summary": "Python command-line client to interact with Cloudsmith API", "version": "0.32.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/adilio/cloudsmith-cli-choco-package/cloudsmith-icon.png", "author": "Cloudsmith", "downloadCount": 252, "tags": ["cloudsmith-cli", "python", "repository", "nuget"]}
