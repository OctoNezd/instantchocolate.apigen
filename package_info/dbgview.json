{"description": "DebugView is an application that lets you monitor debug output on your local system, or any computer on the network\nthat you can reach via TCP/IP. It is capable of displaying both kernel-mode and Win32 debug output, so you don't need\na debugger to catch the debug output your applications or device drivers generate, nor do you need to modify your\napplications or drivers to use non-standard debug output APIs.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@ab7733d9bd5714cac138fe9e5eec447633fb3d75/automatic/dbgview/screenshot.png)\n\n## Notes\n\n* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).\n  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-21T22:03:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dbgview/4.90", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/dbgview/4.90", "licenseUrl": "https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/license-terms", "packageName": "dbgview", "displayName": "DebugView - Windows Sysinternals", "summary": "View and record debug session output without an active debugger", "version": "4.90", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@4a952cb67d3ba380d5d8dc2c26f1c41270affedf/icons/dbgview.png", "author": "Mark Russinovich", "downloadCount": 10081, "tags": ["debug", "monitor", "capture", "tools", "sysinternals"]}
