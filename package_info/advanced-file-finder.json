{"description": "Generate file list of all files with specific name pattern, extension, properties and attributes, as well as text and binary content by recursively scanning specified directories and searching for matching files. All files can then be saved to file list; copied to a new location specified using either absolute or relative folder paths; or renamed. Program can use advanced wildcards, RegEx, and case sensitivity options when checking file names. You can specify file name patterns to exclude from search, as well as directory scanning depth. When looking for files, program can inspect file contents by looking for specific text or byte pattern. File search can be further limited by specifing file size, dates, and attribute parameters.\nProcess 1000s of files using multiple CPU cores in manual, automatic/continuous, triggered/scheduled, or console modes, or directly from Windows Explorer right-click menu. Save files to output directory specified using either absolute or relative path, with original or new name defined by a mask. Perform different operations on different files with conditional processing and process branching. Detailed processing logs are available in both user interface and log files. Run multiple program instances simultaneously.\n\n    Note: This is a fully functional trial version. Processed files are limited in size.", "updated": "2024-03-23T10:04:14Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/advanced-file-finder/5.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/advanced-file-finder/5.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.binarymark.com/eula.aspx", "packageName": "advanced-file-finder", "displayName": "Advanced File Finder", "summary": "Find files matching mask, properties, content", "version": "5.0.0", "icon": "https://www.binarymark.com/img/box/box23_std.png", "author": "BinaryMark", "downloadCount": 1049, "tags": ["advanced-file-finder", "batch", "multiple", "bulk", "mass", "files", "find", "search-contents", "search-bytes", "search-files", "find-files", "trial", "admin"]}
