{"description": "# WhatsappTray\n\nExtension for the Whatsapp Desktop Client, that enables minimize-to-tray and close-to-tray functionality.\n\n## Requirements:\n\n**WhatsApp Desktop Client**: You can download that in the [WhatsApp Official Page](https://www.whatsapp.com/download/)\n\n## Features:\n\n- Minimize/Close button sends WhatsApp window to tray\n- Toggle WhatsApp window by clicking on the tray icon\n- Show unread messages in tray-icon\n- Esc key sends WhatsApp window to tray (optional)\n\n## Configuration:\n\nWhatsappTray can be configured through:\n\n- The **right-click-menue** in the tray. (Changes the values in *appData.ini*)\n- The **appData.ini** which is automatically created in the installation-folder after the first start of WhatsappTray\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\n#### WHATSAPP_STARTPATH\n\nBy default WhatsappTray uses the shortcut that was created when WhatsApp was installed to start WhatsApp.\nIf you want to set a different path to the WhatsApp binary(exe), you can do so by using the 'WHATSAPP_STARTPATH' config in the appData.ini\n\n- *Absolute:* \"WHATSAPP_STARTPATH=C:\\Users\\Dakoon\\AppData\\Local\\WhatsApp\\WhatsApp.exe\"\n- *Relative to the folder in which WhatsappTray.exe lies:* \"WHATSAPP_STARTPATH=.\\..\\WhatsApp.exe\"\n- Support for variables *%UserProfile%* and *%AppData%*\n\n#### Other\n\n- Close to tray feature can also be activated by passing \"--closeToTray\" to WhatsappTray\n\n## Silent install\n\nStart a command line in the same folder where the .exe is located and start the .exe file with the parameters /Silent to install WhatsApp Tray without user input.\n\n## Notice:\n\n**DONT** start the application with administrative rights unless your Whatsapp is also running with administrative rights.\nOtherwise it will **not work** because of communication problems between the two applications.\n\n## Thanks to:\n\nNikolay Redko and J.D.
