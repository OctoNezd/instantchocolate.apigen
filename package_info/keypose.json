{"description": "How often have you found yourself recording a screencast annoyed by the fact that only the mouse is visible? I haven\u2019t seen any screen recording software that provided an easy way to display shortcuts on screen as you type.\n\nMost of the fancy UI stuff happens in OS X land (see Mousepos\u00e9 ) but I needed the functionality under Windows. Microsoft introduced the layered window api in Windows 2000 which makes it possible to create alpha-blended windows with any shape.\n\nSo on a chilly afternoon I sat down and wrote a litte utility that implements a global key logger which diplays all shortcuts and keystrokes as you type \u2013 on screen and with a semi-transparent overlay. This makes it very easy to show any shortcuts you use if you for example record a software demo.", "updated": "2024-03-20T12:33:40Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/keypose/1.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/keypose/1.0.0", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "keypose", "displayName": "KeyPos\u00e9", "summary": "Visual Keylogging", "version": "1.0.0", "icon": "", "author": "Magnus Jungsbluth", "downloadCount": 1660, "tags": ["screencast", "keyboard", "keypress", "logger"]}
