It will even run from a USB stick.\n      It comes complete with it\u2019s own built in Apache web server, PHP and MySQL installations that are started and stopped automatically.\n      Instant WordPress has a set of dummy WordPress posts and pages so that you do not have to create any data or posts to test themes and plugins.\n      It is self-configuring, so it should not conflict with any software already running on your machine.\n      Instant WordPress can be installed as many times as you wish and deleted by simply removing the folder that it is running from. Nothing is left on your machine.\n      Please Note: Instant WordPress is not suitable for live websites and should only be used for testing and development.", "updated": "2024-03-14T03:18:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/instantwordpress/5.3.6", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/instantwordpress/5.3.6", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/corvideon/InstantWP/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "instantwordpress", "displayName": "Instant WordPress", "summary": "Instant WordPress is a complete standalone, portable WordPress development environment.", "version": "5.3.6", "icon": "http://cdn.rawgit.com/WetHat/chocolatey-packages/master/icons/instantwp128x128.png", "author": "Corvideon", "downloadCount": 4195, "tags": ["admin", "instantwp", "instantwordpress", "development", "wordpress", "portable"]}
