{"description": "## Features\n\n### Sketch sections using\n\n- lines, rectangles, datum lines and points\n- circles, arcs of a circle, datum circles\n- cubic Bezier segments, C2 interpolating splines\n- text in a TrueType font, exportable as vectors\n- trims to split lines and curves where they intersect\n- tangent arcs, to fillet lines and curves\n- line styles for stroke color, stroke width, fill color\n- adjustable snap grid, for entities and text\n- menu item, keyboard shortcut, or toolbar\n- cut and paste, in plane and from workplane to workplane\n- background image with specified scale, for ease of tracing\n- 3Dconnexion six degree of freedom controllers\n\n### Constraints and dimensions on\n\n- distance (or line length), point-line distance, diameter\n- projected distance, along a line or vector\n- angle, curve-to-curve tangency, parallel, perpendicular\n- horizontal, vertical\n- equal length, equal angle, equal radius, length ratio\n- line length equals arc length\n- point on line, point on circle, point on point, point on face\n- point at midpoint of line, line's midpoint on plane\n- points (or line) symmetric about line or plane\n- 2d (projected into specified plane) and 3d geometry\n- lengths in metric or inch units\n- lengths entered as arithmetic expressions (32.6 + 5/25.4)\n\n### Build solid model with\n\n- extruded or lathed (solid of revolution) sketch\n- Boolean operations: union (add material), difference (remove material)\n- parametric step and repeat (pattern), rotating or translating\n- operations performed on either meshes or NURBS surfaces\n\n### Parametric and associative assembly\n\n- import parts and drag them with six degrees of freedom\n- import mirrored or with arbitrary scale\n- place parts in assembly using constraints\n- import surfaces, and merge them using Boolean operations\n- import lines and curves, for 2d work or solid operations later\n- changes in parts propagate automatically into assembly\n\n### Analyze with\n\n- measurements on a part or assembly (of point coordinates, line length, point-point distance, point-face distance, projected distance, face-face angle, point-line distance)\n- path traced by mechanism, exportable into a spreadsheet\n- area of a plane sketch, volume of a solid shell\n- degrees-of-freedom check to show unconstrained points in sketch\n- interference check for assemblies\n- STL\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/manual/solvespace/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-21T20:18:48Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/solvespace/3.1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/solvespace/3.1.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solvespace/solvespace/v2.3/COPYING.txt", "packageName": "solvespace", "displayName": "SolveSpace - Parametric 2d/3d CAD", "summary": "SOLVESPACE is a free (GPLv3) parametric 3d CAD tool.", "version": "3.1.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/manual/solvespace/solvespace.png", "author": "SolveSpace contributors.", "downloadCount": 953, "tags": ["solvespace", "parametric", "2d", "3d", "CAD"]}
