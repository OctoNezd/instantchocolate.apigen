{"description": "SIGIL (also styled SI6IL) is an episode WAD for Doom and Ultimate Doom that was released in limited editions on May 22, 2019, while the free release appeared on May 31, 2019. It was announced at Doom's 25th anniversary on December 10, 2018 by its designer, John Romero.\n\n    Although billed as a megawad with 18 maps, Romero clarified in an interview[1] that each of the nine single-player levels includes a separate deathmatch arena, making it a standard episode. The levels were created using Doom Builder 2.\n\n    SIGIL was named as a runner-up at the 2019 Cacowards, although in a break from tradition, its write-up was not contained to the sidebar, instead sharing a \"Runner-up Spotlight\" page with Doom 3: Phobos.\n\n    On December 11, 2019, Bethesda announced support for SIGIL as the first in a series of curated community WADs to be featured as an add-on for the Doom Classic Unity port, added alongside the official Final Doom and No Rest for the Living.[2] The first version of the game allowing users to download SIGIL was released as an update on January 9, 2020.", "updated": "2024-03-21T20:33:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/doom1-maps-sigil/1.21.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/doom1-maps-sigil/1.21.0", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "doom1-maps-sigil", "displayName": "SIGIL Megawad", "summary": "doom1 maps", "version": "1.21.0", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.squarespace.com/static/55e0e96be4b04ea8f08299d0/t/5c0e3979758d469c148d8fe8/1557600470344/?format=500w", "author": "romero", "downloadCount": 684, "tags": ["doom1-maps-sigil", "maps", "doom1", "wad"]}
