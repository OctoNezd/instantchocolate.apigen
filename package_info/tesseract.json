{"description": "This package contains an **OCR engine** - `libtesseract` and a **command line program** - `tesseract`.\nTesseract 4 adds a new neural net (LSTM) based OCR engine which is focused\non line recognition, but also still supports the legacy Tesseract OCR engine of\nTesseract 3 which works by recognizing character patterns. Compatibility with\nTesseract 3 is enabled by using the Legacy OCR Engine mode (--oem 0).\nIt also needs traineddata files which support the legacy engine, for example\nthose from the tessdata repository.\n\nThe lead developer is Ray Smith. The maintainer is Zdenko Podobny.\nFor a list of contributors see [AUTHORS](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/AUTHORS)\nand GitHub's log of [contributors](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/graphs/contributors).\n\nTesseract has **unicode (UTF-8) support**, and can **recognize more than 100 languages** \"out of the box\".\n\nTesseract supports **various output formats**: plain text, hOCR (HTML), PDF, invisible-text-only PDF, TSV. The master branch also has experimental support for ALTO (XML) output.\n\nYou should note that in many cases, in order to get better OCR results, you'll need to **[improve the quality](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/ImproveQuality) of the image** you are giving Tesseract.\n\nThis project **does not include a GUI application**. If you need one, please see the [3rdParty](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/User-Projects-%E2%80%93-3rdParty) wiki page.\n\nTesseract **can be trained to recognize other languages**.
