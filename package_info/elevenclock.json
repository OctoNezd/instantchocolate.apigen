{"description": "ElevenClock is free software (under Apache License 2.0) that lets you put a customizable clock on your Windows 11 taskbar(s). When Microsoft created the Windows 11 clock, they forgot to make it customizable, and to show it on multiple displays. You can customize ElevenClock however you wish \u2014 from adding seconds, to changing its color scheme \u2014 and it appears on all the displays connected to your PC. You can choose to show or hide the clock with full-screen apps, and what happens when you click, double-click or middle-click it. Do you want a clock (or two clocks) on each of your displays? You can have them, and customize them independently, or leave them looking like the Windows\u2019 clock... It\u2019s your choice. ElevenClock is millisecond-accurate, auto-synced with Internet Time... You can even set it to different time zones.", "updated": "2024-03-22T17:18:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/elevenclock/4.3.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/elevenclock/4.3.2", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marticliment/ElevenClock/main/LICENSE", "packageName": "elevenclock", "displayName": "ElevenClock", "summary": "ElevenClock: Customize Windows 11 taskbar clock", "version": "4.3.2", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/marticliment/elevenclock@3.0.0/media/icon.png", "author": "Mart\u00ed Climent", "downloadCount": 2527, "tags": ["elevenclock", "time", "windows", "windows-11", "windows11", "clock", "eleven", "11", "taskbar", "tray", "customize", "customizable", "secondary", "display", "monitor", "screen", "seconds", "taslbar-clock"]}
