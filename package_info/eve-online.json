{"description": "# NOTE:\n\nCCP has updated their launcher and is deprecating their original launcher. This package has been updated to use their new launcher, but because of the differences in the versions of the original launcher and this new launcher, you may have to uninstall this package if it's already installed under one of those old versions and install one of the new versions for the package to upgrade properly again.\n\n# THE #1 SPACE MMO\n\n## YOUR GALACTIC ADVENTURE AWAITS\n\n# WHAT IS EVE ONLINE?\n\nEVE Online is a community-driven spaceship MMORPG where players can play free, choosing their own path from countless options.\n\nExperience space exploration, immense PvP and PvE battles and a thriving player economy in an ever-expanding sandbox.\n\nParticipate in many in-game professions and activities, including war, politics, piracy, trading, and exploration, across 7,000 star systems with hundreds of thousands of other players.\n\n# EVE ACADEMY\n\n## THE ULTIMATE BEGINNER'S GUIDE\n\nWhether you seek glory in the grand wars of Capsuleer nations, amass wealth through trade and industry, earn fortune and reputation in service of New Eden's powerful factions, or simply explore the universe in search of treasures and ancient secrets, you have total freedom to forge your path.\n\n# THE EVER-EVOLVING COMMUNITY OF EVE\n\n## NEW EDEN'S HEART AND SOUL\n\nSince May of 2003, EVE Online has continually brought capsuleers across the world together in a universe of meaningful interaction, where cooperation and friendship are the keys to both fun and fortune - fueling a community unlike any other in the wide world of online gaming. This also extends beyond the screen, with official events such as EVE Fanfest in Reykjavik, Iceland and player gatherings around the world bringing players and developers alike together to reminisce and party, with old comrades and enemies alike, and forge new connections with fellow space friends!\n\nThe EVE community also plays a vital role in the game's development through the Council of Stellar Management (CSM), a democratically elected player council that meets with developers and provides essential feedback on features and content for the world of EVE. We also welcome EVE content creators of all kinds to join the Partnership Program to be rewarded for their passion and creativity.\n\nAdditionally, the EVE Community Team and other developers engage with players daily on Discord and regularly stream on the CCP TV twitch channel - and the EVE Help Center is at your service 24/7 in every supported language. Embark into New Eden and find your place in the incomparable community of EVE Online. We'll see you in space, capsuleer!\n\nFly Safe o7", "updated": "2024-03-23T07:18:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/eve-online/1.3.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/eve-online/1.3.1", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "eve-online", "displayName": "EVE Online Launcher", "summary": "EVE Online: The #1 Space MMO, Your Galactic Adventure Awaits", "version": "1.3.1", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Zoullx/chocolatey-packages/eve-online/eve-online.png", "author": "CCP", "downloadCount": 611, "tags": ["eve-online", "gaming", "launcher"]}
