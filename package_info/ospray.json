{"description": "## Prerequisites\nYour CPU must support at least SSE4.1 to run OSPRay. The TGZ/ZIP packages contain most needed 3rd party dependencies, whereas for the (much smaller) RPM/installer packages you need to have installed:\n\n- Intel\u00ae [TBB](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org) v3.0 or newer\n- [Embree](https://embree.github.io) ray tracing kernels v3.1 or newer\n- To run the example viewer: OpenGL\n- To use the distributed, multi-node rendering feature: Intel\u00ae [MPI Library](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mpi-library).\nWe recommend the latest version of both TBB and Embree libraries.\n\n## Overview\nIntel OSPRay is an **o**pen source, **s**calable, and **p**ortable **ray** tracing engine for high-performance, high-fidelity visualization on Intel Architecture CPUs. OSPRay is part of the [Intel oneAPI Rendering Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/rendering-framework) and is released under the permissive [Apache 2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\nThe purpose of OSPRay is to provide an open, powerful, and easy-to-use rendering library that allows one to easily build applications that use ray tracing based rendering for interactive applications (including both surface- and volume-based visualizations). OSPRay is completely CPU-based, and runs on anything from laptops, to workstations, to compute nodes in HPC systems.\nOSPRay internally builds on top of [Intel Embree](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and [ISPC (Intel SPMD Program Compiler)](https://ispc.github.io), and fully exploits modern instruction sets like Intel SSE4, AVX, AVX2, and AVX-512 to achieve high rendering performance, thus a CPU with support for at least SSE4.1 is required to run OSPRay.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/ospray/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-20T17:33:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ospray/3.1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ospray/3.1.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ospray/ospray/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "ospray", "displayName": "Intel\u00ae OSPRay", "summary": "The Open, Scalable, and Portable Ray Tracing Engine.", "version": "3.1.0", "icon": "", "author": "Intel\u00ae OSPRay Team.", "downloadCount": 1830, "tags": ["ospray", "intel", "ray", "tracing", "engine"]}
