{"description": "Rons HTML Cleaner is a windows application that uses lists of editable rules, called Cleaners, to achieve the cleaning, formatting and layout of HTML that is generated by rich editors (such as Word), before being published to SharePoint, on a Content Management System (CMS), or Blog. It also lists both the anchor and media links in the document and checks that they actually work in the background. This is all done in two simple mouse clicks.\n\nWhen a document is processed the content is also extracted to show just the article and images without the web page extras surrounding.\n\nCleaners can be built from 8 powerful HTML Cleaning rules:\n* Add Tag\n* Change Tag\n* Change Tag Content\n* Delete Tag\n* Set Attribute\n* Delete Attribute\n* Replace Attribute Value\n* Replace Text\n* Text Encoding\n\nFormatting Options:\n* Remove Empty Tags\n* Remove HTML Comments\n\nMore information concerning Rons HTML Cleaner can be found on our website: https://www.ronsplace.ca/Products/RonsHTMLCleaner. The developer welcomes feedback and ideas.", "updated": "2024-03-01T17:48:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ronshtmlcleaner/2023.12.11.849", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ronshtmlcleaner/2023.12.11.849", "licenseUrl": "https://www.ronsplace.ca/Article/Pages/Business/user-license-agreement", "packageName": "ronshtmlcleaner", "displayName": "Rons HTML Cleaner (Install)", "summary": "HTML Cleaner and Processor", "version": "2023.12.11.849", "icon": "https://www.ronsplace.ca/ContentProduct/HTML-CLNR/Icon.png", "author": "Aaron Stewart,  Rons Place Software", "downloadCount": 71, "tags": ["html", "batch", "bulk", "cli", "command", "converter", "file", "formatting", "line", "mass", "multiple", "naming", "parser", "regex", "replace", "replacement", "tags", "text", "word", "clean"]}
