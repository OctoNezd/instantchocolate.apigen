{"description": "## Winbtrfs    \n\nWinBtrfs is a Windows driver for the next-generation Linux filesystem Btrfs.\nA reimplementation from scratch, it contains no code from the Linux kernel,\nand should work on any version from Windows XP onwards. It is also included\nas part of the free operating system [ReactOS](https://www.reactos.org/).\n\nIf your Btrfs filesystem is on a MD software RAID device created by Linux, you\nwill also need [WinMD](https://github.com/maharmstone/winmd) to get this to appear\nunder Windows.\n\nSee also [Quibble](https://github.com/maharmstone/quibble), an experimental\nbootloader allowing Windows to boot from Btrfs, and [Ntfs2btrfs](https://github.com/maharmstone/ntfs2btrfs),\na tool which allows in-place conversion of NTFS filesystems.\n\nFirst, a disclaimer:\n\nYou use this software at your own risk. I take no responsibility for any damage\nit may do to your filesystem. It ought to be suitable for day-to-day use, but\nmake sure you take backups anyway.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Reading and writing of Btrfs filesystems\n* Basic RAID: RAID0, RAID1, and RAID10\n* Advanced RAID: RAID5 and RAID6\n* Caching\n* Discovery of Btrfs partitions, even if Windows would normally ignore them\n* Getting and setting of Access Control Lists (ACLs), using the xattr\n  security.NTACL\n* Alternate Data Streams (e.g. :Zone.Identifier is stored as the xattr\n  user.Zone.Identifier)\n* Mappings from Linux users to Windows ones (see below)\n* Symlinks and other reparse points\n* Shell extension to identify and create subvolumes, including snapshots\n* Hard links\n* Sparse files\n* Free-space cache\n* Preallocation\n* Asynchronous reading and writing\n* Partition-less Btrfs volumes\n* Per-volume registry mount options (see below)\n* zlib compression\n* LZO compression\n* LXSS (\"Ubuntu on Windows\") support\n* Balancing (including resuming balances started on Linux)\n* Device addition and removal\n* Creation of new filesystems with `mkbtrfs.exe` and `ubtrfs.dll`\n* Scrubbing\n* TRIM/DISCARD\n* Reflink copy\n* Subvol send and receive\n* Degraded mounts\n* Free space tree (compat_ro flag `free_space_cache`)\n* Shrinking and expanding\n* Passthrough of permissions etc. for LXSS\n* Zstd compression\n* Windows 10 case-sensitive directory flag\n* Oplocks\n* Metadata UUID incompat flag (Linux 5.0)\n* Three- and four-disk RAID1 (Linux 5.5)\n* New checksum types (xxhash, sha256, blake2) (Linux 5.5)\n\n### Note about Virus Scan Positives\n\nThere is a known issue with the `mkbtrfs.exe` executable triggering false positives in a variety of malware scanners, even when minimal changes are made between versions.\nhttps://github.com/maharmstone/btrfs/issues/252\n\n#### Package Parameters\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n * `/AUTOMOUNT` - Enable automounting of new disks (systemwide, both ntfs and btrfs)\n\nTo pass parameters, use `--params \"''\"` (e.g. `choco install packageID [other options] --params=\"'/ITEM:value /ITEM2:value2 /FLAG_BOOLEAN'\"`).\nTo have choco remember parameters on upgrade, be sure to set `choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`.\n\n\n**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is\nout of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and\nlet them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-23T23:18:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/winbtrfs/1.9.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/winbtrfs/1.9.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/maharmstone/btrfs/blob/master/LICENCE", "packageName": "winbtrfs", "displayName": "WinBtrfs", "summary": "An open-source btrfs driver for Windows", "version": "1.9.0", "icon": "", "author": "maharmstone", "downloadCount": 24265, "tags": ["winbtrfs", "driver", "filesystem"]}
