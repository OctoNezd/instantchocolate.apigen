{"description": "OpenSCAP represents both a library and a command line tool which can be used to parse and evaluate each component of the SCAP standard. The library approach allows for the swift creation of new SCAP tools rather than spending time learning existing file structure. The command-line tool, called oscap, offers a multi-purpose tool designed to format content into documents or scan the system based on this content. Whether you want to evaluate DISA STIGs, NIST\u2018s USGCB, or Red Hat\u2019s Security Response Team\u2019s content, all are supported by OpenSCAP", "updated": "2024-03-19T22:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/openscap/1.35.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/openscap/1.35.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap/blob/maint-1.3/COPYING", "packageName": "openscap", "displayName": "OpenSCAP", "summary": "NIST Certified SCAP 1.2 toolkit", "version": "1.35.0", "icon": "https://landscape.cncf.io/logos/open-scap.svg", "author": "Redhat", "downloadCount": 267, "tags": ["SCAP", "OpenSCAP", "Security"]}
