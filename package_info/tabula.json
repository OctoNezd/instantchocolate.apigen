{"description": "## How Can Tabula Help Me?\nIf you\u2019ve ever tried to do anything with data provided to you in PDFs, you know how painful it is \u2014 there's no easy way to copy-and-paste rows of data out of PDF files. Tabula allows you to extract that data into a CSV or Microsoft Excel spreadsheet using a simple, easy-to-use interface. Tabula works on Mac, Windows and Linux.\n\n## Who Uses Tabula?\nTabula is used to power investigative reporting at news organizations of all sizes, including [ProPublica](http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars), [The Times of London](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/medianews/article4048545.ece), [Foreign Policy](http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2014/06/13/crs_report_details_us_expenses_on_iraq), [La Naci\u00f3n (Argentina)](http://interactivos.lanacion.com.ar/mapa-elecciones-2013), [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/10/us/gun-sales-terrorism-obama-restrictions.html?_r=1) and the [St. Paul (MN) Pioneer Press](http://www.twincities.com/nation/ci_25247140/where-insurance-premiums-are-highest-new-health-laws).\n\nGrassroots organizations like [SchoolCuts.org](http://www.schoolcuts.org) rely on Tabula to turn clunky documents into human-friendly public resources.\n\nAnd researchers of all kinds use Tabula to turn PDF reports into Excel spreadsheets, CSVs, and JSON files for use in analysis and database applications.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/tabula/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-20T09:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/tabula/1.2.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/tabula/1.2.1", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tabulapdf/tabula/master/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "tabula", "displayName": "Tabula", "summary": "Tabula is a tool for liberating data tables locked inside PDF files.", "version": "1.2.1", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/tabula/tabula.png", "author": "Tabula Team.", "downloadCount": 933, "tags": ["tabula", "pdf", "extract", "data", "table"]}
