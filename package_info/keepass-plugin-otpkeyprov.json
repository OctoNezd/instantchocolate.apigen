{"description": "## KeePass Plugin OtpKeyProv\nOtpKeyProv is a key provider based on one-time passwords. After protecting your database using this\nplugin, you need to generate and enter one-time passwords in order to open your database.\n\nAll generator tokens that follow the OATH HOTP standard ([RFC 4226](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4226.txt)) are supported.\n\nIf you instead want KeePass to generate one-time passwords, see the [{HMACOTP}](https://keepass.info/help/base/placeholders.html#hmacotp) placeholder.\n\nFor generating time-based OTPs, see [KeeOtp](https://chocolatey.org/packages/keepass-plugin-keeotp) and [Tray TOTP](https://chocolatey.org/packages/keepass-plugin-traytotp) plugins.\n\n### Package-specific issue\nIf this package isn't up-to-date for some days, [Create an issue](https://github.com/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages/issues/new/choose)\n\nSupport the package maintainer and [![Patreon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@d15c4e19c709e7148588d4523ffc6dd3cd3c7e5e/icons/patreon.png)](https://www.patreon.com/tunisiano)", "updated": "2024-03-23T18:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/keepass-plugin-otpkeyprov/2.7.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/keepass-plugin-otpkeyprov/2.7.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "packageName": "keepass-plugin-otpkeyprov", "displayName": "KeePass Plugin OtpKeyProv", "summary": "Key provider based on one-time passwords", "version": "2.7.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@03577a911ccf66d47e8616f1cd7b37882ee203d7/icons/keepass-plugin-otpkeyprov.png", "author": "Dominik Reichl", "downloadCount": 2515, "tags": ["keepass", "plugin", "security", "otp"]}
