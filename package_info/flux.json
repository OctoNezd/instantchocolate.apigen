{"description": "# Flux CLI\n\n[Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) is a Continuous Delivery solution for Kubernetes. Flux is constructed with the GitOps Toolkit, a set of composable APIs and specialized tools for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration (like Git and Helm repositories), and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy.\n\nFlux is a CNCF incubation project made for:\n\n* **cluster operators** who automate provision and configuration of clusters\n* **platform engineers** who build continuous delivery for developer teams\n* **app developers** who rely on continuous delivery to get their code live\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Source configuration from Git and Helm repositories, and S3-compatible buckets (e.g., Minio)\n* Kustomize and Helm support\n* Event-triggered and periodic reconciliation\n* Integration with Kubernetes RBAC\n* Health assessment (clusters and workloads)\n* Dependency management (infrastructure and workloads)\n* Secrets management (builtin support for Mozilla SOPS and Cloud KMS)\n* Alerting to external systems (webhook senders)\n* External events handling (webhook receivers)\n* Automated container image updates to Git (image scanning and patching)\n* Policy-driven validation (OPA, Kyverno, admission controllers)\n* Seamless integration with Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)\n* Interoperability with Cluster API (CAPI) providers\n\nFor more information please visit https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2.", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:48:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/flux/2.2.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/flux/2.2.3", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "flux", "displayName": "Flux CLI", "summary": "An optional command line interface to be used with Flux", "version": "2.2.3", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/jimpruitt/chocolatey-packages/master/flux2/flux2.png", "author": "Linux Foundation (CNCF)", "downloadCount": 28335, "tags": ["flux", "flux2", "fluxctl", "gitops", "kubernetes", "devops", "cli", "docker", "containers"]}
