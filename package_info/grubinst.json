It enables dos users to run the configuration console directly in real mode.\n\nGNU GRUB (short for GNU GRand Unified Bootloader) is a boot loader package from the GNU Project. GRUB is the reference implementation of the Free Software Foundation's Multiboot Specification, which provides a user the choice to boot one of multiple operating systems installed on a computer or select a specific kernel configuration available on a particular operating system's partitions.\n\nGNU GRUB was developed from a package called the Grand Unified Bootloader (a play on Grand Unified Theory[5]). It is predominantly used for Unix-like systems. The GNU operating system uses GNU GRUB as its boot loader, as do most Linux distributions and the Solaris operating system on x86 systems, starting with the Solaris 10 1/06 release.", "updated": "2024-03-14T18:33:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/grubinst/1.0.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/grubinst/1.0.1", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "packageName": "grubinst", "displayName": "grubinst", "summary": "grubinst is an GUI utility intends to help configuring and installing GRUB for DOS in the WINDOWS environment", "version": "1.0.1", "icon": "", "author": "Tinybit", "downloadCount": 775, "tags": ["grubinst", "grub4dos", "grub", "bootloader"]}
