{"description": "# mairix\nmairix is a program for indexing and searching email messages stored in Maildir, MH, MMDF or mbox folders.\n* Indexing is fast.  It runs incrementally on new messages - any particular message only gets scanned once in the lifetime of the index file.\n* The search mode populates a \"virtual\" folder with symlinks(*) which point to the real messages.  This folder can be opened as usual in your mail program.\n* The search mode is very fast.\n* Indexing and searching works on the basis of words.  The index file tabulates which words occur in which parts (particular headers + body) of which messages.\n  \nThe program is a very useful complement to mail programs like mutt (http://www.mutt.org/, which supports Maildir, MH and mbox folders) and Sylpheed (which supports MH folders).", "updated": "2024-03-15T10:33:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/mairix/0.22", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/mairix/0.22", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/vandry/mairix/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "mairix", "displayName": "mairix", "summary": "mairix is a program for indexing and searching email messages stored in Maildir, MH, MMDF or mbox folders.", "version": "0.22", "icon": "", "author": "Richard Curnow", "downloadCount": 176, "tags": ["index", "search", "email", "mail", "message", "maildir", "mbox", "unix", "commandline"]}
