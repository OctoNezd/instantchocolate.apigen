{"description": "Copay is an easy-to-use, open-source, multiplatform, multisignature, secure bitcoin wallet platform for both individuals and companies. Copay uses [Bitcore Wallet Service](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service) (BWS) for peer synchronization and network interfacing.\n\nCopay is a true bitcoin wallet, not an account service. Secure your personal funds with multiple signatures, or just one.\n\nTake security into your own hands and avoid trusting third parties with your savings. Like a joint-checking account, your Copay wallet can have multiple users. To send money, the group approves each transaction.\n\nManage shared funds with friends and coworkers. Share a wallet with your child and introduce them to bitcoin. Copay makes sharing a wallet simple and secure.", "updated": "2024-03-20T09:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/copay/4.6.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/copay/4.6.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/bitpay/copay/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "copay", "displayName": "Copay", "summary": "Open-source, multi-platform, multi-signature, secure bitcoin wallet platform", "version": "4.6.2", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/bitpay/copay/320de62f137715d238b7cf1c25dcd73efd6e4e09/public/img/icons/icon.png", "author": "BitPay", "downloadCount": 7781, "tags": ["bitcoin", "btc", "cryptocurrency", "blockchain", "wallet", "multisig", "admin"]}
