{"description": "DBGL is an open-source, free, multi-platform Java frontend for DOSBox, based largely upon the proven interface of D-Fend. It tries to make creating DOSBox configuration files a little easier by offering a simple interface, some shortcuts and a little bit of intelligence. Once your DOS games are configured in DBGL, its very easy to setup or start them, or alter their configuration or associated DOSBox version.", "updated": "2024-03-20T15:33:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dbgl/0.96.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/dbgl/0.96.0", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html", "packageName": "dbgl", "displayName": "DOSBox Game Launcher", "summary": "DOSBox Game Launcher", "version": "0.96.0", "icon": "https://dbgl.org/img/256.png", "author": "Ronald Blankendaal", "downloadCount": 6404, "tags": ["dbgl", "dos", "game", "games", "launcher", "dosbox"]}
