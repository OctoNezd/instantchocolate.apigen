{"description": "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:\n\n- a powerful N-dimensional array object\n- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions\n- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code\n- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities\nBesides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.\n\nNumPy is licensed under the [BSD license](https://www.numpy.org/license.html), enabling reuse with few restrictions.\n\n## Getting Started\nTo install NumPy, we strongly recommend using a ***scientific Python distribution***. See [Installing the SciPy Stack](https://www.scipy.org/install.html) for details.\n\nMany high quality online tutorials, courses, and books are available to get started with NumPy. For a quick introduction to NumPy we provide the [NumPy Tutorial](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html). We also recommend the [SciPy Lecture Notes](https://scipy-lectures.org) for a broader introduction to the scientific Python ecosystem.\n\nFor more information on the SciPy Stack (for which NumPy provides the fundamental array data structure), see [scipy.org](https://www.scipy.org).\n\n## Documentation\nThe most up-to-date NumPy documentation can be found at [Latest (development) version](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs). It includes a user guide, full reference documentation, a developer guide, meta information, and \u201cNumPy Enhancement Proposals\u201d (which include the NumPy Roadmap and detailed plans for major new features).\n\nA complete archive of documentation for all NumPy releases (minor versions; bug fix releases don\u2019t contain significant documentation changes) since 2009 can be found at https://docs.scipy.org.", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:48:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/numpy/1.26.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/numpy/1.26.4", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/numpy/numpy/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "numpy", "displayName": "NumPy", "summary": "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.", "version": "1.26.4", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/numpy/numpy.png", "author": "NumPy developers", "downloadCount": 18047, "tags": ["numpy", "python", "scientific", "computing"]}
