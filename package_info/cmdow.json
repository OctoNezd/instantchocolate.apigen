{"description": "Cmdow is a Win32 commandline utility for NT4/2000/XP/2003/2008/7 that allows windows to be listed, moved, resized, renamed, hidden/unhidden, disabled/enabled, minimized, maximized, restored, activated/inactivated, closed, killed and more.\n\nIt is a small standalone executable. It does not create any temporary files, nor does it write to the registry. There is no installation procedure, just run it. To completely remove all traces of it from your system, delete it.\n\nCmdow was written with batch file programmers in mind. Particular attention has been paid to Cmdows output making it easy to process with the 'FOR /F' command found in the Windows command processor (cmd.exe).", "updated": "2024-03-23T14:18:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/cmdow/1.4.8.20180816", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/cmdow/1.4.8.20180816", "licenseUrl": "https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT", "packageName": "cmdow", "displayName": "CMDOW Commandline Window Utility", "summary": "Cmdow is a Win32 commandline utility for NT4/2000/XP/2003/2008/7 that allows windows to be listed, moved, resized, renamed, hidden/unhidden, disabled/enabled, minimized, maximized, restored, activated/inactivated, closed, killed and more", "version": "1.4.8.20180816", "icon": "", "author": "Ritchie Lawrence", "downloadCount": 6665, "tags": ["cli", "window", "foss", "scripting", "admin"]}
