{"description": "Asymptote is a powerful, descriptive, vector-graphics language with a natural coordinate-based framework for technical drawing, inspired by [MetaPost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaPost) but with an improved C++-like syntax. Asymptote provides the same high-quality typesetting for figures that LaTeX does for scientific and mathematics text.\n    \nA major advantage of Asymptote over other graphics packages is that it is a programming language, as opposed to just a graphics program.\n\nYou can even run it in your browser without installing it, using the [Asymptote Web Application](https://tinyurl.com/asyweb). Just enter the code: **import workcone;** (including the semicolon) and click the `Run` button.\n\n![Venn diagram example](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/proj/asymptote/screenshots/14498.jpg/max/max/1)\n\n### Features of Asymptote:\n* provides a portable standard for typesetting mathematical figures, just as TeX/LaTeX has become the standard for typesetting equations;\n* generates high-quality PostScript, PDF, SVG, WebGL, and PRC vector graphics;\n* embeds 3D vector WebGL graphics within HTML files;\n* embeds 3D vector PRC graphics within PDF files;\n* inspired by MetaPost, with a much cleaner, powerful C++-like programming syntax and IEEE floating-point numerics;\n* runs on all major platforms (UNIX, MacOS, Microsoft Windows);\n* mathematically oriented (e.g. rotation of vectors by complex multiplication);\n* LaTeX typesetting of labels (for document consistency);\n* uses the simplex method and deferred drawing to solve overall size constraint issues between fixed-sized objects (labels and arrowheads) and objects that should scale with figure size;\n* fully generalizes MetaPost path construction algorithms to three dimensions;\n* compiles commands into virtual machine code for speed without sacrificing portability;\n* high-level graphics commands are implemented in the Asymptote language itself, allowing them to be tailored to specific applications. \n\n### Recommended additional packages\n* [MiKTeX](https://chocolatey.org/packages/miktex.install) or another TEX implementation (i.e. [TeX Live](https://chocolatey.org/packages/texlive)) will be required to typeset labels.\n* [Ghostscript](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ghostscript.app)\n* [ImageMagick](https://chocolatey.org/packages/imagemagick.app) is required to support output formats other than HTML, PDF, SVG, and PNG.\n* [Python3](https://chocolatey.org/packages/python3) or [Anaconda3](https://chocolatey.org/packages/anaconda3) is only needed if you wish to try out the graphical user interface ([see Chapter 11](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/doc/GUI.html#GUI) of the documentation.)", "updated": "2024-03-23T13:48:37Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/asymptote/2.88.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/asymptote/2.88.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/vectorgraphics/asymptote/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "asymptote", "displayName": "Asymptote", "summary": "The Vector Graphics Language", "version": "2.88.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages@8e46d032c99545e508abe5941a9f5e781eac48ee/Icons/asymptote_icon.png", "author": "Andy Hammerlindl,  John Bowman,  Tom Prince", "downloadCount": 1457, "tags": ["asymptote", "vector", "graphics", "language", "technical", "drawing", "latex", "figures", "mathematics", "OSS", "embedded"]}
