{"description": "CellProfiler Analyst (CPA) allows interactive exploration and analysis of data, particularly from high-throughput, image-based experiments. Its most popular feature is a supervised machine learning system (\"Classifier\") that can be trained to recognize complicated and subtle phenotypes, for automatic scoring of millions of cells. CPA provides tools for exploring and analyzing multidimensional data, particularly data from high-throughput, image-based experiments analyzed by its companion image analysis software, CellProfiler.\n\nThe CellProfiler project is based at the Broad Institute Imaging Platform. It was started by Anne E. Carpenter and Thouis (Ray) Jones in the laboratories of David M. Sabatini and Polina Golland at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and MIT\u2019s CSAIL.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/j12EQH5.png\"><br><br>\n</div>", "updated": "2024-03-23T06:18:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/cellprofiler-analyst/3.0.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/cellprofiler-analyst/3.0.4", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/CellProfiler/CellProfiler-Analyst/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "cellprofiler-analyst", "displayName": "CellProfiler-Analyst", "summary": "CellProfiler Analyst allows interactive exploration and analysis of data, particularly from high-throughput, image-based experiments.
