You can choose your desired skin already there or change it when you are in the skins mode by rightclicking somewhere on the skin and going to Interface>Choose Skin.\nVLC needs to be restarted to change to skins mode.", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:18:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vlc-skins/2017.01.13", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vlc-skins/2017.01.13", "licenseUrl": "https://www.videolan.org/legal.html", "packageName": "vlc-skins", "displayName": "VLC Skins (Install)", "summary": "Skins (themes) for VLC", "version": "2017.01.13", "icon": "https://rawgit.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages/3952380efd0776bea6d964ed4e28efa979b434d2/icons/vlc.png", "author": "Various", "downloadCount": 6238, "tags": ["vlc", "skins", "admin"]}
