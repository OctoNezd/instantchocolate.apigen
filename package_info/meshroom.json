{"description": "Meshroom is a free, open-source 3D Reconstruction Software based on the [AliceVision](https://github.com/alicevision/AliceVision) Photogrammetric Computer Vision framework.\n\nLearn more details about the pipeline on [AliceVision website]'http://alicevision.github.io).\n\nSee [results of the pipeline on sketchfab](http://sketchfab.com/AliceVision).\n\n## Requirement\nNVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPU (compute capability >= 2.0).\n\n## Photogrammetry\nPhotogrammetry is the science of making measurements from photographs. It infers the geometry of a scene from a set of unordered photographs or videos. Photography is the projection of a 3D scene onto a 2D plane, losing depth information. The goal of photogrammetry is to reverse this process.\n\nSee the [presentation of the pipeline steps](http://alicevision.github.io/#photogrammetry).\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/meshroom/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-21T17:48:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/meshroom/2021.1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/meshroom/2021.1.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alicevision/meshroom/v2019.1.0/LICENSE-MPL2.md", "packageName": "meshroom", "displayName": "Meshroom", "summary": "Meshroom is a free, open-source 3D Reconstruction Software based on the AliceVision Photogrammetric Computer Vision framework.", "version": "2021.1.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/meshroom/meshroom.png", "author": "AliceVision Team.", "downloadCount": 2709, "tags": ["meshroom", "3D", "reconstruction", "alicevision", "photogrammetric", "computer", "vision", "framework"]}
