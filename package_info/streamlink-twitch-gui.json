{"description": "# Streamlink Twitch GUI\n\nA multi platform Twitch.tv browser for Streamlink\nBrowse Twitch.tv and watch streams in your video player of choice\n\nA graphical user interface (GUI) on top of the [Streamlink][Streamlink] command line interface (CLI).\nBuilt with [NW.js][NW.js], a web application platform written in JavaScript ([EmberJS][EmberJS]), HTML ([Handlebars][Handlebars]), and CSS ([LessCSS][LessCSS]). Powered by [Chromium][Chromium] and [Node.js][Node.js].\n\n\n## Features\n\n* Available on Windows, macOS and Linux\n* Watch streams in the video player of your choice via Streamlink\n* Watch multiple streams at once\n* Browse streams by popularity, game, channel or team\n* Access your followed streams and channels\n* Filter streams by channel- or broadcasting language\n* Receive desktop notifications when new streams start\n* Join the Twitch chat by using customizable chat applications\n* Rich settings menu with lots of customizations and presets\n* Individual channel settings\n* Available in multiple languages\n* Automatic or custom selection of light and dark themes\n* Customizable hotkeys\n* Command line parameters for automation purposes\n\n\n## Why?\n\nOne of the reasons for having bad viewing experiences on [Twitch.tv][Twitch.tv] is the implementation of their resource-heavy website and HTML5 video player. Especially on mobile desktop devices, high CPU and memory usage and lack of GPU acceleration of the web browser can cause major issues like buffering, stuttering or low video playback frame rates, all while draining the device\u2019s battery and spinning up its fans. Even on desktop computers, watching streams on Twitch.tv while multi-tasking can be an issue.\n\nWith Streamlink Twitch GUI you\u2019re not dependent on your web browser and streams can be watched in the video player of your choice, enabling a smooth video playback. Depending on your choice of player, additional features become available, like for example timeshift support or resolution/framerate upscaling. In addition to that, Streamlink\u2019s variable stream buffers will help you countering bad network conditions or reducing the stream\u2019s latency even further.\n\nPlease bear in mind that you\u2019re bypassing any ads run by [Twitch.tv][Twitch.tv] by using this software. If you want to support Twitch or a single broadcaster, please consider buying [Twitch Prime][Twitch Prime] or subscribing to the broadcaster\u2019s channel. Thank you!\n\n\n## Package parameters\n\n* `/Purge` - (uninstall) delete appdata and cache folders upon install\n\nExample: `choco uninstall streamlink-twitch-gui -y -params '\"/Purge\"'`\n\n  [Streamlink]: https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink \"Streamlink\"\n  [Twitch.tv]: https://twitch.tv \"Twitch.tv\"\n  [Twitch Prime]: https://twitch.amazon.com/prime \"Twitch Prime\"\n  [NW.js]: https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js \"NW.js\"\n  [EmberJS]: http://emberjs.com/ \"EmberJS\"\n  [Handlebars]: http://handlebarsjs.com/ \"Handlebars.js\"\n  [LessCSS]: http://lesscss.org/ \"LessCSS\"\n  [Node.js]: https://nodejs.org \"Node.js\"\n  [Chromium]: https://www.chromium.org/ \"Chromium\"", "updated": "2024-03-23T18:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/streamlink-twitch-gui/2.4.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/streamlink-twitch-gui/2.4.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink-twitch-gui/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "streamlink-twitch-gui", "displayName": "Streamlink Twitch GUI", "summary": "A multi platform Twitch.tv browser for Streamlink", "version": "2.4.1", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/streamlink/streamlink-twitch-gui/master/src/app/assets/icons/icon-256.png", "author": "Sebastian Meyer", "downloadCount": 35713, "tags": ["streamlink", "twitch", "gui", "livestreamer", "streaming"]}
