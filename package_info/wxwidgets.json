{"description": "wxWidgets is a C++ library that lets developers create applications for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and other platforms with a single code base. It has popular language bindings for Python, Perl, Ruby and many other languages, and unlike other cross-platform toolkits, wxWidgets gives applications a truly native look and feel because it uses the platform's native API rather than emulating the GUI. It's also extensive, free, open-source and mature.", "updated": "2024-03-21T05:18:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/wxwidgets/3.1.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/wxwidgets/3.1.2", "licenseUrl": "https://www.wxwidgets.org/about/licence/", "packageName": "wxwidgets", "displayName": "wxWidgets", "summary": "Cross-Platform GUI Library", "version": "3.1.2", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/Thieum/ChocolateyPackages/master/wxwidgets/development-wxwidgets.png", "author": "wxWidgets", "downloadCount": 6796, "tags": ["c++", "wx", "widgets", "ui"]}
