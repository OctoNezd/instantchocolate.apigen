{"description": "The audio analysis features of REW help you optimise the acoustics of your listening room, studio or home theater and find the best locations for your speakers, subwoofers and listening position. It includes tools for generating audio test signals; measuring SPL and impedance; measuring frequency and impulse responses; measuring distortion; generating phase, group delay and spectral decay plots, waterfalls, spectrograms and energy-time curves; generating real time analyser (RTA) plots; calculating reverberation times; calculating Thiele-Small parameters; determining the frequencies and decay times of modal resonances; displaying equaliser responses and automatically adjusting the settings of parametric equalisers to counter the effects of room modes and adjust responses to match a target curve.", "updated": "2024-03-22T13:18:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/roomeqwizard/5.18", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/roomeqwizard/5.18", "licenseUrl": "http://www.roomeqwizard.com/eula.html", "packageName": "roomeqwizard", "displayName": "Room EQ Wizard", "summary": "REW is free room acoustics analysis software for measuring and analysing room and loudspeaker responses.", "version": "5.18", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/angryhussord/choco_roomeqwizard/ab5202e5260219a88d8adc4ca0443815763daece/room-eq-wizard-icon.PNG", "author": "John Mulcahy", "downloadCount": 3337, "tags": ["audio", "sound", "acoustic", "parametric", "equalizer", "frequency", "room", "admin"]}
