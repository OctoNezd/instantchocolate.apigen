{"description": "Legendary is an open-source game launcher that can download and install games from the Epic Games platform on Linux and Windows.\nIt's name as a tongue-in-cheek play on tiers of [item rarity in many MMORPGs](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Quality).\n\nRight now Legendary is in beta and not feature-complete. You might run into some bugs or issues.\nIf you do please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/derrod/legendary/issues/new) so we can fix it.\n\n**What works:**\n - Authenticating with Epic's service\n - Downloading and installing your games and their DLC\n - Delta patching/updating of installed games\n - Launching games with online authentication (for multiplayer/DRM)\n - Syncing cloud saves (compatible with EGL)\n - Running games with WINE on Linux\n - Importing/Exporting installed games from/to the Epic Games Launcher\n\n**Planned:**\n - Simple GUI for managing/launching games\n - Better interfaces for other developers to use Legendary in their projects\n - Lots and lots of bug fixes, optimizations, and refactoring...\n \n## Maintainer Notice\nAnti-virus, anti-malware, and heuristic engines might catch and label this software as a threat. While I retain the notion that this is indeed a false positive caused by [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/), this is a proper warning given ahead-of-time. If you use any of these security products then you'd would likely need to disable them temporarily to allow install, or add an exception for the software.", "updated": "2024-03-23T05:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/legendary/0.20.34", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/legendary/0.20.34", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/derrod/legendary/blob/0.20.34/LICENSE", "packageName": "legendary", "displayName": "Legendary (Portable)", "summary": "Free and open-source Epic Games Launcher alternative", "version": "0.20.34", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/Starz0r/ChocolateyPackagingScripts/94d6eabf4bafdd0b9196d5c439e5c5dfa9a8f46d/assets/legendary.min.svg", "author": "derrod", "downloadCount": 7825, "tags": ["cli", "python", "gaming", "epic-games", "epicgames-launcher", "epic-games-launcher", "epic-games-client"]}
