{"description": "This package performs miscellaneous actions to customize your command line experience.\n\n      1. Set environment variable \u00ab chocolatey_bin_root \u00bb to C:\\Tools, only if it's not already set. Some packages that would otherwise install into system root will look for this variable. Packages that behave in this way are: Ruby, Python etc - almost any package that is not comfortable with spaces in filenames.\n      2. Permanently sets HOME environment variable to a valid value, if not already set.\n      3. Installs \u00ab setenv \u00bb command that refreshes environment variables without the need to restart command shell. Sometimes very useful.\n      4. Establishes a flexible system of auto-run include files, specified in user's home directory. After that, any file residing in home directory looking like \u00ab .bashrc.include.*.bat \u00bb gets auto-executed at every command shell start.\n\n      Automatic uninstall procedure is included in this package, so you don't need to manually reverse whatever actions installer did. This procedure will unset \u00ab chocolatey_bin_root \u00bb variable (1.) but will not do anything to remove effects of (2.), (3.) and (4.) because these settings are very unobtrusive.\n\n      NOTE: Phrase \u00ab Devbox \u00bb in a name of this package is used as signature to indicate high quality standards. Functionally, the package is the same as any other Chocolatey package.", "updated": "2024-03-22T10:04:07Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/Devbox-Common/1.0.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/Devbox-Common/1.0.2", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "Devbox-Common", "displayName": "Devbox Common Settings", "summary": "Devbox-Common", "version": "1.0.2", "icon": "https://github.com/michfield/devbox-choco/raw/master/Devbox-Common/Devbox-Common.png", "author": "Michael Field,  Ethan Brown", "downloadCount": 14833, "tags": ["devbox", "admin", "path", "binroot"]}
