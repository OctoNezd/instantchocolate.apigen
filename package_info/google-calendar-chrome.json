And if you\u2019re on sites that have special events encoded, you can click the button to instantly add events to your calendar. The button shows an orange plus sign whenever there are events on the page you\u2019re viewing that can be added to your calendar.\n\n###FEATURES\n\u2022 Displays events from your selected calendars.\n\u2022 Quick Add: When adding events, you no longer need to specify a time separately. Type events such as:\n  \u2014 \u201cDinner with Sam at 8pm Sunday\u201d, or\n  \u2014 \u201cVacation from Dec 25 to Dec 31\u201d\n\u2022 If you\u2019re on certain sites where it detects the presence of events, the icon changes to an orange \u201c+\u201d. Clicking that icon lets you add the event to your Google Calendar, and shows you a map (if there\u2019s a location it could detect.)\n\u2022 Any site that uses the hCalendar microformat or derivative microformats such as hResume are supported.\n\u2022 This extension shows events from whatever calendars you are logged in within Chrome.\n\u2022 If you want to use a Google Apps calendar, you should login to that account first, then open the extension.\n\n[Android Client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar) | [iOS Client](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-calendar/id909319292)\n \n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/google-calendar-chrome/readme.md)**", "updated": "2024-03-23T21:18:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/google-calendar-chrome/2.8", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/google-calendar-chrome/2.8", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "google-calendar-chrome", "displayName": "Google Calendar (by Google) for Chrome", "summary": "Easily check Google Calendar and add new events from websites you visit.", "version": "2.8", "icon": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/foIlOOzsv0jbTTd67d_WVXH2frdRMlgjTrdDrDAgNWMoqjXmUaG8TgLsXixcpYa2ysoMUwntgfU=w26-h26-e365", "author": "chrome.google.com", "downloadCount": 2910, "tags": ["google", "calendar", "chrome", "extension"]}
