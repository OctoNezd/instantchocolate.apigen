{"description": "# Purpose\n\n`wsudo` is a Linux `sudo`-like tool for Windows to invoke a program with elevated rights (as Administrator) from a non-admin shell command prompt.\nThis implementation doesn't depend on the legacy Windows Script Host (`CScript`). Instead, it uses a helper PowerShell 5.1 script that invokes `\"Start-Process -Wait -Verb runAs ...\"` cmdlet. Your system most likely already has PowerShell 5.x installed, otherwise you'll be offered to install it as a dependency.\n\n# Usage\n\n`wsudo` runs a program or an inline command with elevated rights in the current directory. Examples:\n\n    wsudo .\\myAdminScript.bat \n    wsudox \"del C:\\Windows\\Temp\\*.* && pause\"\n    wasudo cup all -y\n    wasudox start notepad C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts \n    wasudog wt.exe -d %cd%\n\n**For more details, visit the [GitHub repro](https://github.com/noseratio/choco/tree/master/wsudo).**", "updated": "2024-03-23T20:03:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/wsudo/1.0.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/wsudo/1.0.3", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/noseratio/choco/blob/main/LICENSE", "packageName": "wsudo", "displayName": "wsudo", "summary": "Run elevevated shell commands from the command line.", "version": "1.0.3", "icon": "", "author": "Andrew Nosenko", "downloadCount": 13777, "tags": ["sudo", "runas", "run", "shell", "command", "line", "powershell", "cmd", "admin", "administrator"]}
