{"description": "## UltraDMM aims to unify software DMM analysis.\n\nUltraDMM was originally created to replace the DMM software that ships with Uni-Trend UT series meters. It quickly grew from that point with many advanced features.\n\n### Features:\n\n* Support for multiple simultaneous meters\n* Advanced Triggers can alert via audio or visual feedback on meter value change\n* Analog/Digital Gauges can help represent the data more accurately\n* Gauges can combine values from multiple meters via various algorithms\n* Virtual meters that can aid in simulations\n* Save workspaces for common scenarios and sharing among group of engineers\n* Export data for more later analysis in Excel", "updated": "2024-03-17T20:18:51Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ultradmm/1.0.5.37035", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ultradmm/1.0.5.37035", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "ultradmm", "displayName": "UltraDMM (Install)", "summary": "UltraDMM aims to unify software DMM analysis.", "version": "1.0.5.37035", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/belidzs/chocolatey-ultradmm/icons/ultradmm.png", "author": "Kaskingo Inc.", "downloadCount": 528, "tags": ["ultradmm"]}
