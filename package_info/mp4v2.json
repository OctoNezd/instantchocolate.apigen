{"description": "The MP4v2 library provides an API to create and modify mp4 files as defined by ISO-IEC:14496-1:2001 MPEG-4 Systems. This file format is derived from Apple's QuickTime file format that has been used as a multimedia file format in a variety of platforms and applications. It is a very powerful and extensible format that can accommodate practically any type of media.\n\nMP4v2 was originally bundled with mpeg4ip library, but has been moved into its own maintained library due to a combination of the cessation of support of mpeg4ip and the usefulness of this library on its own.", "updated": "2024-03-22T19:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/mp4v2/4.1.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/mp4v2/4.1.3", "licenseUrl": "http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/", "packageName": "mp4v2", "displayName": "mp4v2", "summary": "This is a fork of mp4v2 from https://code.google.com/archive/p/mp4v2/.
