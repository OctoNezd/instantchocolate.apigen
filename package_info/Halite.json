The program also relies on the Boost libraries.\n\nFeatures:\nWhile still at an early state of development Halite is a functional BitTorrent client. So far its list of features is pretty standard but that is because I want to ensure it does the basic stuff well.\n\nThat said, it supports:\n\nFile selection and/or file priority specifications.\n'Managed torrent' queue system.\nDisk cache support.\nTrackerless torrents (using the Mainline kademlia DHT protocol).\nMagnet URIs.\nSuper-seeding.\nuTorrent style multi-tracker announcement.\nIP filtering with eMule style ipfilter.dat import.\nProtocol Encryption support.\nTranslations of the UI into a number of languages through the help of volunteers. (if you wish to help with a translation then please do)\nMinimise to tray with transfer rate summary.\nFull Unicode support through UTF-8 and native Windows wide-char strings.\nLogin support where tracker requires it.\nAbility to edit trackers specified in the torrent.\nTransfer rate and connection limits both global and per-torrent.\nTorrent file creation.\nPort randomisation and forwarding (UnPlug and Play or NAT-PMP)\nCompatible with UAC.\nShutdown scheduler.\nWebseeds\nCode Repository: https://github.com/Eoinocal/Halite\n\nRequirements: Vista and higher", "updated": "2024-03-23T00:03:34Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/Halite/0.4.0.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/Halite/0.4.0.4", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/Eoinocal/Halite/blob/master/LICENSE_1_0.txt", "packageName": "Halite", "displayName": "Halite", "summary": "A Free Open-Source BitTorrent client", "version": "0.4.0.4", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eoinocal/Halite/master/res/Halite.ico", "author": "E\u00f3in O'Callaghan", "downloadCount": 1661, "tags": ["torrent", "magnet", "client", "dht", "download"]}
