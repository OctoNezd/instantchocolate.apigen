{"description": "Under Linux there aren\u2019t many freely available vector graphics editors and as far as I know there are none that can edit EPS (encapsulated postscript) and PDF (portable document format) files. I produce lots of these files in my day-to-day work and I would like to be able to edit them. The best vector graphics editor I have found so far is Inkscape but it only reads SVG files\u2026 (Edit: recent versions can import PDFs but I\u2019m not entirely happy with how text is imported; in particular, that fonts are not imported from the PDF.)\n\n      To overcome this problem I have written a very small utility to convert PDF files to SVG files using Popplerand Cairo. Version 0.2.2 is available here (with modifications by Matthew Flaschen and Ed Grace). This appears to work on any PDF document that Poppler can read (try them in XPDF or Evince since they both use Poppler).\n\n      So now it is possible to easily edit PDF documents with your favourite SVG editor! One other alternative would be to use pstoedit but the commercial SVG module costs (unsurprisingly!) and the free SVG module is not very good at handling text\u2026", "updated": "2024-03-21T12:03:39Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pdf2svg/0.2.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pdf2svg/0.2.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/db9052/pdf2svg/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "pdf2svg", "displayName": "pdf2svg (Install)", "summary": "Convert PDF to SVG", "version": "0.2.2", "icon": "", "author": "David Barton", "downloadCount": 5432, "tags": ["pdf", "svg"]}
