{"description": "Visual Studio Code Insiders is the pre-release build of Visual Studio Code.\n\nVisual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. It's free, build on open source and available on your favorite platform - Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Meet IntelliSense:** Go beyond syntax highlighting and autocomplete with IntelliSense, which provides smart completions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules.\n- **Print statement debugging is a thing of the past:** Debug code right from the editor. Launch or attach to your running apps and debug with break points, call stacks, and an interactive console.\n- **Git commands built-in:** Working with Git and other SCM providers has never been easier. Review diffs, stage files, and make commits right from the editor. Push and pull from any hosted SCM service.\n- **Extensible and customizable:** Want even more features? Install extensions to add new languages, themes, debuggers, and to connect to additional services. Extensions run in separate processes, ensuring they won't slow down your editor. [Learn more about extensions.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery)\n- **Deploy with confidence and ease:** With [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) you can deploy and host your React, Angular, Vue, Node, Python (and more!) sites, store and query relational and document based data, and scale with serverless computing, all with ease, [all from within VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/extensions).\n\n## Package parameters\n\n- `/NoDesktopIcon` - Don't add a desktop icon.\n- `/NoQuicklaunchIcon` - Don't add an icon to the QuickLaunch area.\n- `/NoContextMenuFiles` - Don't add an _Open with Code Insiders_ entry to the context menu for files.\n- `/NoContextMenuFolders` - Dont't add an _Open with Code Insiders_ entry to the context menu for folders.\n- `/DontAssociateWithFiles` - Dont't associate Visual Studio Code Insiders with supported files.\n- `/DontAddToPath` - Don't add Visual Studio Code Insiders to the system PATH.\n\nExample: `choco install vscode-insiders.install --params \"/NoDesktopIcon /DontAddToPath\"`\n\n## Notes\n\n- The package uses default install options except that it adds context menu entries and Visual Studio Code Insiders isn't started after installation.\n- For disabling the auto-update functionality see the [Visual Studio Code Auto Update Deactivation package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/visualstudiocode-disableautoupdate).\n- **If the package is out of date please check [Version History](#versionhistory) for the latest submitted version.
