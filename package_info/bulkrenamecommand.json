{"description": "Bulk Rename Command (BRC) is a simple command-line utility which allows you to rename multiple files and folders, based upon flexible criteria. BRC is a natural alternative from my existing [Bulk Rename Utility](https://chocolatey.org/packages/bulkrenameutility) software, as it allows you to rename files without the use of a Graphical User Interface. \n\nThis makes it ideally suited to batch environments and server environments, or where you need to rename files on a regular basis with the same requirements.", "updated": "2024-03-20T14:48:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/bulkrenamecommand/1.3.3.20170403", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/bulkrenamecommand/1.3.3.20170403", "licenseUrl": "http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/License.php", "packageName": "bulkrenamecommand", "displayName": "Bulk Rename Command", "summary": "Allows you to easily rename files and folders recursively based upon find-replace, character place, fields, sequences, regular expressions, EXIF data, and more.", "version": "1.3.3.20170403", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/glachance/Chocolatey/master/bulkrenameutility.png", "author": "Jim Willsher, TGRMN Software", "downloadCount": 1589, "tags": ["batch", "rename", "regex", "file", "command", "line"]}
