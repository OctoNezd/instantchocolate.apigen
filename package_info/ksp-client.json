{"description": "The Sassafras KeyServer Platform Client pairs with the a KeyServer/AllSight server to discover hardware attributes and installed software applications, delivering trustworthy details about each Windows, Mac, and Linux machine (including virtual and thin-client) where it is installed. Sassafras\u2019 cloud-hosted Product Recognition Service (PRS) then normalizes virtually every software product installed on client computers.\n    \nSassafras provides IT Administrators and other stakeholders real-time access to hardware and software inventory, usage stats, license management, and compliance reports. Live availability maps with integrated intelligent software search give students on-demand access to available assets.\n\n## Notes\n* This package is useless by itself.  You will need a [Sassafras KSP](https://www.sassafras.com/) back-end which is a licensed, enterprise product.  \n* The KSPclient is forward and backward compatible with a wide range of versions of KeyServer/AllSight.\n\n### Options\n#### Host parameter\nThe KSP server (\"KeyServer\") with which the client will interface is best specified at installation using a `/Host` package parameter argument. For example:\n\n`choco install k2client --params '\"/Host:ksp.example.com\"'`\n\n#### Source parameter\nYou may specify a `/Source` package parameter to an alternate server (i.e. a local server, not [Sassafras](https://www.sassafras.com/download)) from which KSPclient can be downloaded.  Newer versions of KeyServer/AllSight can push updated clients and can share the latest client for an initial install by this package. (Contact Sassafras support to find out how.)  *If the installers are altered or of a different version than this package, the `--ignorechecksums` switch must be used.* For example:\n\n`choco install k2client --params '\"/Host:k2.example.com /Source:k2.example.com/kami\"'`\n\n#### Additional installer options\nThe KSPclient has [additional options ](https://www.sassafras.com/hrl/7.6/deployment.html#options) that should normally not be needed but can be used via `--installarguments` (or `--ia`).  For example:\n\n`choco install k2client --params '\"/Host:k2.example.com\"' --ia '\"-v PROP_LOCKED=1\"'", "updated": "2024-03-22T04:03:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ksp-client/8.0.0.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ksp-client/8.0.0.2", "licenseUrl": "https://www.sassafras.com/legal-sla/", "packageName": "ksp-client", "displayName": "Sassafras KeyServer Platform Client (\"KeyAccess\")", "summary": "Vital component for IT Asset Management and Cost Reduction", "version": "8.0.0.2", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages@984302e79afe84f8f021c7f300091c4b8544f86e/Icons/ksp-client_icon.png", "author": "Sassafras", "downloadCount": 1658, "tags": ["ksp-client", "ksp", "k2", "keyaccess", "keyserver", "allsight", "client", "sassafras", "inventory", "license", "tracking", "commercial", "enterprise"]}
