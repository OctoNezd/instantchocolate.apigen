{"description": "Rainmeter displays customizable skins, like memory and battery power, RSS feeds and weather forecasts, right on your desktop. Many skins are even functional: they can record your notes and to-do lists, launch your favorite applications, and control your media player - all in a clean, unobtrusive interface that you can rearrange and customize to your liking. Rainmeter is at once an application and a toolkit. You are only limited by your imagination and creativity.\n\n\"Unofficial\" means that this package is not maintained by the Rainmeter developers. The setup file is the same you would download on the official website.", "updated": "2024-03-23T23:18:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rainmeter/4.3.0.3321", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/rainmeter/4.3.0.3321", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0", "packageName": "rainmeter", "displayName": "Rainmeter (Unofficial)", "summary": "Rainmeter, desktop customization tool.", "version": "4.3.0.3321", "icon": "https://rawgit.com/aronovgj/chocolatey/a4d186f47d8efacaed3cca1b010799566fc9253f/icons/rainmeter.png", "author": "Rainmeter", "downloadCount": 54756, "tags": ["admin", "rainmeter", "customization"]}
