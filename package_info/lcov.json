{"description": "LCOV is an extension of GCOV, a GNU tool which provides information about\n  what parts of a program are actually executed (i.e. \"covered\") while running\n  a particular test case. The extension consists of a set of Perl scripts\n  which build on the textual GCOV output to implement the following enhanced\n  functionality:\n\n    - HTML based output: coverage rates are additionally indicated using bar\n      graphs and specific colors.\n\n    - Support for large projects: overview pages allow quick browsing of\n      coverage data by providing three levels of detail: directory view,\n      file view and source code view.\n\n  LCOV was initially designed to support Linux kernel coverage measurements,\n  but works as well for coverage measurements on standard user space\n  applications.", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:48:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/lcov/1.15.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/lcov/1.15.0", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "lcov", "displayName": "lcov (Install)", "summary": "LCOV for Windows", "version": "1.15.0", "icon": "", "author": "The Linux Test Project", "downloadCount": 111383, "tags": ["lcov"]}
