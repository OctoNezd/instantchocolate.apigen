{"description": "Appium Desktop is an open source app for Mac, Windows, and Linux which gives you the power of the Appium automation server in a beautiful and flexible UI. It is a combination of a few Appium-related tools:\n\n- A graphical interface for the Appium Server. You can set options, start/stop the server, see logs, etc... You also don't need to use Node/NPM to install Appium, as the Node runtime comes bundled with Appium Desktop.\n- An Inspector that you can use to look at your app's elements, get basic information about them, and perform basic interactions with them. This is useful as a way to learn about Appium or as a way to learn about your app so you can write tests for it.", "updated": "2024-03-23T18:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/appium-desktop/1.20.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/appium-desktop/1.20.2", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appium/appium-desktop/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "appium-desktop", "displayName": "Appium", "summary": "Appium Server and Inspector in Desktop GUI", "version": "1.20.2", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/usamaejaz/chocolatey-packages/e9444321/icons/appium-desktop.png", "author": "Appium", "downloadCount": 10275, "tags": ["appium-desktop", "appium", "automation", "testing", "mobile"]}
