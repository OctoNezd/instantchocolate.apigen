{"description": "### More powerful plugins\n- The msgpack API enables structured communication to and from any programming language.\n- Remote plugins run as co-processes that communicate with Neovim safely and asynchronously.\n\n### Better out-of-the-box\n- Strong defaults\n- Modern terminal features such as truecolor and bracketed paste\n- Built-in terminal emulator\n- First-class embedding\n- GUIs (or TUIs\u2014such as readline) can nvim --embed or communicate via TCP socket using the discoverable msgpack API.\n\n### Drop-in replacement for Vim\n- Neovim is an extension of Vim: feature-parity and backwards compatibility are high priorities.\n- If you are already familiar with Vim, see :help nvim-from-vim to learn about the differences.\n\n### Following HEAD\n- If you want to stay up to date with the latest development you can install neovim using the `--pre` option.\n- For example: `choco install neovim --pre`. \n- Which will get you the latest _nightly_ builds for windows.\n\n### Package Parametes\n- `/NoNeovimOnPath`: Neovim binary folder will not be added to the path.\n\t- Optional parameter.\n\t- Default behavior is that Neovim binary will be added to the users path.\n\t- If this is used together with `/NeovimOnPathForAll`, this takes precedence and the path will not be modified.\n\t- Example: `choco install neovim --params \"/NoNeovimOnPath\"`\n- `/NeovimOnPathForAll`: Neovim binary folder will be added to the machine path.\n\t- Optional parameter.\n\t- Default behavior is that Neovim binary will be added only to the users path.\n\t- Example: `choco install neovim --params \"/NeovimOnPathForAll\"`\n\n**Note:** ~~To force the installation of x32 version, use the `--x86` argument with `choco install`.~~\n\nAs of [#16317](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/16317) Win32 builds and releases were removed", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/neovim/0.9.5", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/neovim/0.9.5", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neovim/neovim/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "neovim", "displayName": "Neovim", "summary": "Vim-fork focused on extensibility and usability.", "version": "0.9.5", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/neovim/neovim/68e2d722/cmake.packaging/neovim.png", "author": "Neovim contributors", "downloadCount": 396681, "tags": ["vi", "vim", "gvim", "neovim", "text", "editor", "sublime", "atom", "emacs", "notepad"]}
