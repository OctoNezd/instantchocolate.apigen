{"description": "## foldingathome\nFoldit is an online game in which humans try to solve one of the hardest computational problems \nin biology: protein folding. You don't need to know anything about biology to play the game, \nalthough a little background will help. Most of the players of Foldit are not biologists.\n\n[Science behind Foldit](http://fold.it/portal/info/about)\n\n#### Documentation\n* [New players](http://foldit.wikia.com/wiki/Foldit_Wiki#New_Players)\n* [FAQ](http://fold.it/portal/info/faq)\n* [Wiki](http://foldit.wikia.com/)\n\n#### Community\n* [Forum](http://fold.it/portal/forum/5)\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/folditgame)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/foldit)\n\n### Package-specific issue\nIf this package isn't up-to-date for some days, [Create an issue](https://github.com/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages/issues/new/choose)\n\nSupport the package maintainer and [![Patreon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@d15c4e19c709e7148588d4523ffc6dd3cd3c7e5e/icons/patreon.png)](https://www.patreon.com/tunisiano)", "updated": "2024-03-10T07:18:24Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/foldit/0.0.20220915", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/foldit/0.0.20220915", "licenseUrl": "https://fold.it/legal", "packageName": "foldit", "displayName": "Foldit", "summary": "Solve puzzles for science research", "version": "0.0.20220915", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@7cc8d197a0daa3297060d92a75902352d1cce156/icons/foldit.png", "author": "UW Center for Game Science", "downloadCount": 4875, "tags": ["citizen-science", "biology", "protein-folding", "game", "puzzle", "admin"]}
