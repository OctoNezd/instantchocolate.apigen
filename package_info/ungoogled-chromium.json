{"description": "ungoogled-chromium is a set of configuration flags, patches, and custom scripts. These components altogether strive to accomplish the following:\n* Disable or remove offending services and features that communicate with Google or weaken privacy\n* Strip binaries from the source tree, and use those provided by the system or build them from source\n* Add, modify, or disable features that inhibit control and transparency (these changes are minor and do not have significant impacts on the general user experience)\n\nungoogled-chromium should not be considered a fork of Chromium. The main reason for this is that a fork is associated with more significant deviations from the Chromium, such as branding, configuration formats, file locations, and other interface changes. ungoogled-chromium will not modify the Chromium browser outside of the project's goals. Since these goals and requirements are not precise, unclear situations are discussed and decided on a case-by-case basis.", "updated": "2024-03-23T23:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ungoogled-chromium/122.0.6261.1281", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ungoogled-chromium/122.0.6261.1281", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-windows/blob/122.0.6261.128-1.1/LICENSE", "packageName": "ungoogled-chromium", "displayName": "ungoogled-chromium (Portable)", "summary": "Modifications to Google Chromium for removing Google integration and enhancing privacy, control, and transparency.", "version": "122.0.6261.1281", "icon": "https://glcdn.githack.com/dimqua/choco/raw/stable/icons/ungoogled-chromium.png", "author": "ungoogled-software", "downloadCount": 92513, "tags": ["ungoogled", "chromium", "ungoogled-chromium", "blink", "chrome", "privacy", "security", "browser"]}
