{"description": "The MATLAB Runtime is a standalone set of shared libraries that enables the execution of compiled MATLAB applications or components on computers that do not have MATLAB installed. \n    \n#### Notes\n* The version of the MATLAB Runtime necessary to run an application is tied to the version of MATLAB used to create the application.\n* Multiple versions of the MATLAB Runtime may simultaneously exist on a target machine. This allows applications compiled with different versions of the MATLAB Runtime to execute side by side on the same machine.\n* The MATLAB Runtime Compiler is large (3.9GB).  It will take some time to download and install.", "updated": "2024-03-14T02:48:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/mcr-r2021b/9.11.0.2179507", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/mcr-r2021b/9.11.0.2179507", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages/master/manual/mcr-r2019a/MCR_license.txt", "packageName": "mcr-r2021b", "displayName": "MATLAB Compiler Runtime R2021b", "summary": "Run compiled MATLAB applications.", "version": "9.11.0.2179507", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages@f5f5b9f6b5afc7dc7446a22954b865f21bd7d80c/Icons/matlab_icon.png", "author": "The Mathworks,  Inc.", "downloadCount": 167, "tags": ["MATLAB", "compiler", "runtime", "math", "mathematics", "library"]}
