{"description": "# Free Graphical User Interface for NGEN\n    \n    Invantive Dotnet Optimizer provides a graphical user interface to NGEN. It allows you to easily optimize the start time of your Microsoft .NET applications by pre-compiling the executable and related assemblies into native code. \n    \n    #32 and 64 bit native versions\n    \n    The Dotnet Optimizer always generates both 32 and 64 bit native versions of your code, since subtleties in how .NET chooses the runtime version easily impact the performance perceived by your end users. The Invantive Dotnet Optimizer ensures your users wait till the compilation into native code has been finished. \n    \n    # Easy to bundle\n    \n    You can facilitate your end users by packaging the executable as a resource in your assembly. From the menu, you can unpack it and run it with elevated privileges. The Invantive Dotnet Optimizer has been tested to correctly process ClickOnce applications as well as VSTO-based add-ins for Microsoft Office deployed through ClickOnce.", "updated": "2024-03-21T04:03:43Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/invantive-dotnet-optimizer/17.8.8", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/invantive-dotnet-optimizer/17.8.8", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "invantive-dotnet-optimizer", "displayName": "Invantive Dotnet Optimizer", "summary": "Graphical user interface to NGEN", "version": "17.8.8", "icon": "https://www.invantive.com/any/img/productthumbs/invantive-dotnet-optimizer-128x128.png", "author": "Invantive Software B.V.", "downloadCount": 895, "tags": ["invantive", "dotnet", "optimizer", "ngen"]}
