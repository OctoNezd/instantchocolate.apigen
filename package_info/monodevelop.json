{"description": "MonoDevelop is a free GNOME IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages, although open to any kind of language. However, MonoDevelop hopes to be more than just an IDE: it intends to be an extensible platform upon which any kind of development tool can be built.\n\nMonoDevelop was originally a port of the SharpDevelop IDE to Gtk#, but it has evolved a lot since the initial port.\n\nThere are numerous goals that MonoDevelop hopes to achieve. Some of these are:\n\n* To create a best of breed development environment for Unix systems for Mono.\n* Since its written in Gtk#, and we like Gtk# and we get good support from Gtk#, most likely it will add functionality to improve the Gtk# experience.\n* We want to integrate the tools we have been building so far, so things like MonoDoc, NUnit-Gtk and the debugger should target MonoDevelop.\n\n#### Documentation\n* [Screenshots](http://www.monodevelop.com/screenshots/)\n* [FAQ](http://www.monodevelop.com/help/faq/)\n* [Manual](http://www.monodevelop.com/documentation/)\n* [Developers](http://www.monodevelop.com/developers/)", "updated": "2024-03-23T06:03:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/monodevelop/5.10.1.6", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/monodevelop/5.10.1.6", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html", "packageName": "monodevelop", "displayName": "MonoDevelop", "summary": "Cross platform IDE for C#, F# and more", "version": "5.10.1.6", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/bae8c08374744857d3b9827c9a1463c94a683ea8/icons/monodevelop.png", "author": "Xamarin", "downloadCount": 11324, "tags": ["mono", "ide", "dotnet"]}
