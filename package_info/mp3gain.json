{"description": "MP3Gain analyzes and adjusts mp3 files so that they have the\n    same volume. MP3Gain does not just do peak normalization, as many\n    normalizers do. Instead, it does some statistical analysis to determine how\n    loud the file actually sounds to the human ear. Also, the changes MP3Gain\n    makes are completely lossless. There is no quality lost in the change\n    because the program adjusts the mp3 file directly, without decoding and\n    re-encoding.\n    http://github.com/svnpenn/p/tree/master/mp3gain", "updated": "2024-03-22T18:48:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/mp3gain/1.5.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/mp3gain/1.5.2", "licenseUrl": "http://gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1", "packageName": "mp3gain", "displayName": "MP3Gain", "summary": "", "version": "1.5.2", "icon": "http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/images/mp3gainlogosmall.gif", "author": "Glen Sawyer", "downloadCount": 3150, "tags": ["audio"]}
