{"description": "Indentex is an indentation-based superset of LaTeX. An Indentex source file is more concise and visually less cluttered than an equivalent LaTeX file. Its indentation-based syntax was inspired by Python. Transpiling an Indentex source file yields a plain LaTeX file, which can be used further in your toolchain, sent to a publisher or your colleagues.", "updated": "2024-03-14T07:18:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/indentex/0.5.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/indentex/0.5.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mp4096/indentex/master/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "indentex", "displayName": "Indentex", "summary": "A transpiler for an indentation-based superset of LaTeX.", "version": "0.5.0", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/mp4096/indentex/7b464e29/doc/images/icon.png", "author": "Mikhail Pak,  Hans Kirchner", "downloadCount": 990, "tags": ["latex", "transpiler", "rust"]}
