{"description": "#### New package name: __[cmder](https://chocolatey.org/packages/cmder)__\n\n- - -\n\n`cmder.portable` has been deprecated because of Chocolatey Community [Naming Conventions](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CreatePackages#naming-your-package). Community packages with an ID ending in `.install`/`.portable` are intended to indicate there are two possible methods for installing a program. If a user comes across one of these ID endings, it is expected an associated package with the corresponding ID ending also exists. The program `cmder` only provides a portable method so the simplest ID should be used.\n\nThis package exists only for backward compatibility to provide a transitional, empty dummy package for existing users and scripts which may still use this package ID.", "updated": "2024-03-11T03:33:23Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/cmder.portable/1.1.4.102", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/cmder.portable/1.1.4.102", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "cmder.portable", "displayName": "[DEPRECATED] Cmder (Portable)", "summary": "Portable console emulator", "version": "1.1.4.102", "icon": "", "author": "Samuel Vasko", "downloadCount": 27834, "tags": ["deprecated"]}
