Ten years old and still the best... in fact, now even better!\n\nNo spyware, no adware, no nagware, no ever-expanding bloat of pointless 'features', just pure, simple, and elegant as always.\n\nThe screen saver supports multiple monitors, so this time the Matrix really will have you...\n\nIf you like the screensaver and feel so inclined, please [donate](https://www.meticulous-software.co.uk/donationware.htm).", "updated": "2024-03-22T09:04:24Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/thematrix/1.15", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/thematrix/1.15", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages/tree/master/manual/thematrix/legal/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "thematrix", "displayName": "The Matrix (screensaver)", "summary": "Delve into The Matrix", "version": "1.15", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages@4236281ac8ec0ef1fbcea4819ea8b5025ed544d6/Icons/thematrix_icon.png", "author": "Philip Symons", "downloadCount": 1379, "tags": ["thematrix", "matrix", "screensaver", "freeware", "embedded"]}
