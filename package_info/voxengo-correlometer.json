{"description": "Correlometer is a free analog-style stereo multi-band correlation meter AudioUnit, AAX and VST plugin for professional music production applications.  It is based on correlation meter found in PHA-979 phase-alignment plugin.\n\nMulti-band correlation meter is an advanced way to check for presence of out-of-phase elements in the mix.  Broadband correlation metering reports overall phase issues and may misrepresent problems present in select spectral bands, while multi-band correlation meter easily highlights problems present in mid to high frequencies that are not easily heard by ear, but may still reduce clarity of the mix.  Another application of multi-band correlation metering is phase- and time-aligning of channels and tracks, especially bass and bass-drum pairs, guitar mic and D.I. source pairs, two-microphone stereo recordings, etc.\n\nCorrelometer can display 4 to 64 individual spectral bands, with adjustable band quality factor that controls the degree of band\u2019s selectivity.  Averaging time of correlation estimator can be adjusted.  Correlometer supports side-chain inputs for easy correlation estimation between separate audio tracks.\n\n## Package Specific\n\n### Package Parameters\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n * `/NoVst2x86`       - Do not install the x86 VST2 version\n * `/NoVst2x64`       - Do not install the x64 VST2 version\n * `/NoVst3x86`       - Do not install the x86 VST3 version\n * `/NoVst3x64`       - Do not install the x64 VST3 version\n * `/NoAaxx86`        - Do not install the x86 AAX version\n * `/NoAaxx64`        - Do not install the x64 AAX version\n * `/NoShortcuts`     - Do not install shortcuts to manuals and uninstaller into start menu or onto desktop\n * `/Vst2Path:`       - Installation path of the VST2 version\n * `/Vst2x86Path:` - Installation path of the x86 VST2 version on x64 CPU architecture\n * `/InstallerPath:`  - Do not download the installer from the official Voxengo website and use the one passed with this argument instead.
