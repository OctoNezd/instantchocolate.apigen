{"description": "Angband is a complex single player dungeon simulation. A player (you!) creates a character, choosing from a variety of\nraces and classes, and then plays that character over a period of days, weeks, even months.\n\nThe player will begin their adventure on the town level where they may acquire supplies, weapons, armor, and magical\ndevices by buying from various shop owners. Then the player can descend into the Pits of Angband, where they will\nexplore the many levels of the dungeon, gaining experience by killing fierce creatures, collecting powerful objects and\nvaluable treasure, and returning to town occasionally to buy supplies. Eventually, as the player grows more experienced,\nthey may attempt to win the game by defeating Morgoth, the Lord of Darkness, who resides far below the surface.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@926dac932143d2ce85b90d4657f34ba04e2b57d6/automatic/angband/screenshot.png)\n\n## Package Parameters\n\nThe following package parameter can be set:\n\n* `/AddToDesktop` - add a desktop shortcut for Angband.
