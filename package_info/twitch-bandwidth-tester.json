{"description": "I've created a program for streamers called TwitchTest that will test your upload speed to each Twitch server and report the sustained bandwidth. It's important to know what kind of bandwidth you can get so you can set an appropriate bitrate on your stream to avoid dropped frames. You'll want to leave enough room for your game and other data so don't just set your bitrate to the highest number, and keep in mind Twitch's maximum recommendation of 3500kbps.", "updated": "2024-03-22T14:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/twitch-bandwidth-tester/1.520", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/twitch-bandwidth-tester/1.520", "licenseUrl": "http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/tech-support/478845-twitchtest-twitch-bandwidth-tester#1", "packageName": "twitch-bandwidth-tester", "displayName": "Twitch Bandwidth Tester", "summary": "I've created a program for streamers called TwitchTest that will test your upload speed to each Twitch server and report the sustained bandwidth", "version": "1.520", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/galeksandrp/chocolatey-packages/fc895c84eaf43607f89e4fa383a3ce47833b6820/icons/twitch-bandwidth-tester.png", "author": "R1CH", "downloadCount": 3429, "tags": ["twitch-bandwidth-tester", "twitch", "streaming", "gaming", "steam", "origin", "uplay"]}
