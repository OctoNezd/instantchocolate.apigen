{"description": "# Undark\nUndark is a tool that will go through your entire SQLite database file and dump out all rows of data it finds still intact ( both current and deleted rows ). Undark does not differentiate between current and deleted data. The output of Undark is plain text CSV format.\n\nThis project is forked from http://pldaniels.com/undark.\n\n**What Undark can do**:\n* Retrieve most available records from a SQLite3 DB and dump them to stdout\n* Dump normal (visible) records to stdout\n* Dump deleted (unvacuumed) records to stdout\n* Retrieve data from corrupted SQLite DBs (because it only examines data on a per record basis)\n\n**What Undark can't do**:\n* Recover data that's already been vacuumed out of the file\n* Magically put the records back in to your db file\n\n\n## Usage\n```\nundark -i {sqlite DB} [-d] [-v] [-V|--version]\n  [--cellcount-min=count] [--cellcount-max=count] \n  [--rowsize-min=bytes] [--rowsize-max=bytes]\n  [--no-blobs] [--blob-size-limit=bytes]\n  [--fine-search]\n        -i: input SQLite3 format database\n        -d: enable debugging output (very large dumps)\n        -v: enable verbose output\n        -V|--version: show version of software\n        -h|--help: show this help\n        --cellcount-min: define the minimum number of cells a row must have to be extracted\n        --cellcount-max: define the maximum number of cells a row must have to be extracted\n        --rowsize-min: define the minimum number of bytes a row must have to be extracted\n        --rowsize-max: define the maximum number of bytes a row must have to be extracted\n        --no-blobs: disable the dumping of blob data\n        --blob-size-limit: all blobs larger than this size are dumped to .blob files\n        --fine-search: search DB shifting one byte at a time, rather than records\n```\n\n## Example usage\n```\n$ undark.exe -i sms.db\n'8079','C6CA760C-948C-4CDC-86B2-85D527C8E523','Fingers crossed','0',NULL,'47',NULL,NULL,'blob','10','0','iMessage'\n'8076','D5F4356C-F0F4-4507-B767-587627709C5F','Did u remind the kids I''m picking them up this afternoon?','0',NULL,'47',NULL,NULL,'blob','10','0','iMessage'\n```", "updated": "2024-03-14T11:48:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/undark/0.7", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/undark/0.7", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/alitrack/undark/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "undark", "displayName": "Undark", "summary": "Undark - a SQLite recovery tool for deleted data or corrupt database.", "version": "0.7", "icon": "", "author": "Paul L Daniels, contributors", "downloadCount": 200, "tags": ["sqlite", "recover", "recovery", "deleted", "data", "corrupt", "corrupted", "database", "commandline"]}
