{"description": "## KeePass KPScript\nKPScript allows automating database operations in KeePass. There are two ways to automate KeePass: single command operations and KPScript files:\n\n* [Command Operations](http://keepass.info/help/v2_dev/scr_index.html): KPScript can be invoked using\nsingle commands. By passing the database location, its key, a command and eventually some parameters,\nsimple operations like adding an entry can be performed. The syntax is very simple, no scripting\nknowledge is required. This method is ideal when you quickly want to do some small changes to the\ndatabase. It is not recommended when you need to perform many operations, because for each command the\ndatabase needs to be loaded from file, decrypted, modified, encrypted and written back to file.\n* [C# Script Files](http://keepass.info/help/v2_dev/scr_kps_index.html): These files are a lot more\npowerful than single command operations, but are also more complicated. You need to have heavy\nexperience in C# programming and the KeePass 2.x internals. Within KPS files you can do everything that\nKeePass does.\n\n### Package-specific issue\nIf this package isn't up-to-date for some days, [Create an issue](https://github.com/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages/issues/new/choose)\n\nSupport the package maintainer and [![Patreon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@d15c4e19c709e7148588d4523ffc6dd3cd3c7e5e/icons/patreon.png)](https://www.patreon.com/tunisiano)", "updated": "2024-03-19T11:03:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/keepass-plugin-kpscript/2.56.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/keepass-plugin-kpscript/2.56.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "packageName": "keepass-plugin-kpscript", "displayName": "KeePass Plugin KPScript", "summary": "Plugin for KeePass 2.x to automate database operations", "version": "2.56.0", "icon": "", "author": "Dominik Reichl", "downloadCount": 20353, "tags": ["keepass", "plugin", "automate", "cli"]}
