This leaves your email inbox at risk of spam, marketing junk and unimportant messages that waste your time. Even worse, there\u2019s a danger of receiving malware, viruses or becoming the victim of online abuse. Dedicated email address tagging software is perfect for when you:\n\n* Need to sign up to a website but you\u2019re worried that your email address might get shared with third-party advertisers.\n* Are required to provide an email address to a mobile app that shouldn\u2019t be sending you messages.\n* Make a one-off purchase on an e-commerce site and you don\u2019t want to receive follow-up spam emails about their latest offers.\n* Publish your email address in a location like a forum where it could be picked up by address-harvesting spam bots or phishing software.\n* Give out your address to companies that are known for having poor levels of online security.\n* Effectively eliminate the threat of unsolicited emails from third parties and drastically reduce the quantity of junk emails your organization receives.\n\n###How does it work?\n1. A user purchases an item online from www.thinkboxart.com.\n2. At the checkout, they are asked to provide their email address, which is john.doe@mycompany.com.\n3. A unique tag is chosen to help easily identify the site that the user is giving their email address to e.g. \u201cthinkboxart\u201d.\n4. A tag can be made up of any combination of alphanumeric characters.\n5. The email address will now be either: john.doe+thinkboxart@mycompany.com or john.doe--thinkboxart@mycompany.com.\n\n###Stop spam dead in its tracks\n\n* Get total protection against all spam emails when you use Exclaimer Address Tagging for Exchange with Exclaimer Anti-spam.\n* Users will be able to stop any unsolicited email, while the Recurrent Pattern Detection\u00ae engine from CYREN\u00ae compares every email your organization receives via Exchange against the current global spam traffic trends.\n\nPACKAGING REMINDER: Will only install on Exchange Servers with Hub Transport, Edge Transport, or Mailbox Role installed.", "updated": "2024-03-16T11:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/address-tagging-exchange/1.0.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/address-tagging-exchange/1.0.1", "licenseUrl": "https://www.exclaimer.com/address-tagging-for-exchange/", "packageName": "address-tagging-exchange", "displayName": "Exclaimer Address Tagging for Exchange (Install)", "summary": "Create and manage any number of disposable email addresses for free using unique tags in Exchange.", "version": "1.0.1", "icon": "https://a8b03ffbc00ed4da54a1-0c6684360696717b63d89dbc0edb802c.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/exclaimer-logo_192x41.png", "author": "Exclaimer Limited", "downloadCount": 745, "tags": ["exclaimer", "address", "tagging", "exchange", "server", "disposable", "corporate", "email", "e-mail", "admin"]}
