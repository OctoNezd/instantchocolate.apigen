{"description": "Eask was built to use as a package development tool in your Elisp packages. But\nnow, Eask supports various types of Emacs Lisp tasks. It can be used in three\nmajor ways:\n\n1. Dev tool for Elisp packages\n2. Dependency management for your configuration\n3. Run elisp programs for all other purposes\n\nSo what are the major differences between Eask and other build tools like\n[Cask][], [makem.sh][], and [Eldev][], other than the things above?\n\nGood question! Eask is more than a build tool now, it can be used for various\npurposes! But here are Eask aims to be:\n\n- **Consistent** enough to sandbox across all systems\n- **General** enough to have Emacsers frequently used commands (`byte-compile`, `checkdoc`, etc)\n- **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of user errors\n- **Dependency-free** so that the tool can be run on any platform\n\nFor more information, find the manual at https://emacs-eask.github.io/\n\n\n[Cask]: https://github.com/cask/cask\n[makem.sh]: https://github.com/alphapapa/makem.sh\n[Eldev]: https://github.com/doublep/eldev", "updated": "2024-03-09T09:48:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/eask-cli/0.9.5", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/eask-cli/0.9.5", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/emacs-eask/cli/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "eask-cli", "displayName": "Eask CLI", "summary": "Dependency management for Emacs Lisp", "version": "0.9.5", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/emacs-eask/cli/eb7c1f29d65679e532bb8d094eb2f7faa7b492ca/docs/static/logo.png", "author": "jcs090218", "downloadCount": 135, "tags": ["eask", "emacs", "cli"]}
