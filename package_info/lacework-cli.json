{"description": "The Lacework CLI is an [open source project](https://github.com/lacework/go-sdk/tree/main/cli) written\nin Golang and released as separate binaries for Linux, macOS, and, yes, even Windows! Additionally, all releases of the\nCLI are published as [Docker containers to Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lacework/lacework-cli) for various\nplatforms with the intended purpose of integrating with CI/CD automation pipelines.\n\nLacework as a platform provides a set of robust APIs for configuring accounts within the platform, as well as accessing\ndata from accounts. The Lacework CLI provides an interface to those APIs with the goal of providing fast, accurate, and\nactionable insights into the platform.\n\nFor more details, go to https://docs.lacework.com/cli\n\n---\n\n## Important Notice\n\nSince the release of the Lacework CLI version `1.30.0` we noticed that the virus scan reports positive findings. We\nhave analyzed the generated binaries and we have not found any virus.\n\nThis is a **common false-positive** in the Golang community for Windows binaries. For details, go to https://golang.org/doc/faq#virus\n\n---", "updated": "2024-03-23T21:03:47Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/lacework-cli/1.49.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/lacework-cli/1.49.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lacework/go-sdk/main/LICENSE", "packageName": "lacework-cli", "displayName": "Lacework CLI", "summary": "A tool to manage the Lacework cloud security platform.", "version": "1.49.0", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/lacework/go-sdk/main/scripts/chocolatey/lacework.png", "author": "Lacework", "downloadCount": 2657, "tags": ["lacework", "cli", "cloud", "security"]}
