{"description": "The best editor for translating apps and sites (that use gettext). Simple. Fast. Easy to use.\n\n### Anything Gettext (PO)\n\nWrite translations for any software or web site that uses Gettext for localization. Gettext is used widely, in many programming languages and many projects \u2013 from WordPress to many PHP projects, Django or pretty much anything on Linux.\n\n### Simple and Efficient Interface\n\nPoedit is intentionally spartan so that the focus is on the translation you\u2019re working on. Just you and the translation, no distractions.\n\nGettext can be tricky at times. One accidentally added % may break things if you\u2019re unlucky. Not to worry, though, Poedit checks for common problems and warns you.\n\n### Translation Memory\n\nPoedit comes with a builtin translation memory to help you translate faster. It remembers your past translations and uses them to make suggestions for similar texts. Over time, it learns enough to fill in frequently used strings for you.\n\n### For Developers Too\n\nDevelopers can use Poedit to maintain their translation files (or templates) and keep them fresh. It may be too simple for more complicated projects, but most of the time, that simplicity comes handy.\n\n### Poedit Pro\n\nThe Pro version is a paid in-app upgrade that enhances Poedit with additional features and benefits:\n\n- Save Time with Pre-translation\n- WordPress Themes and Plugins\n- Twig Templates\n- Word Count\n- Personal Support", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:48:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/poedit/2.4.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/poedit/2.4.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/vslavik/poedit/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "poedit", "displayName": "Poedit", "summary": "Poedit translations editor.
