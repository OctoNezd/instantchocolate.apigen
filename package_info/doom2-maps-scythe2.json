{"description": "Scythe 2 is a 32-level megawad for Doom II. Released by Erik Alm in June of 2005. It was re-released July 10th 2009 with the three missing levels. It has been regarded by many as a spiritual successor to Scythe rather than a direct sequel. While the original featured small, action-packed levels, Scythe 2 is filled with large, complex and detailed maps, and is sometimes compared to the style of Alien Vendetta.", "updated": "2024-03-21T20:33:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/doom2-maps-scythe2/25.03.2005", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/doom2-maps-scythe2/25.03.2005", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "doom2-maps-scythe2", "displayName": "Scythe2 (Doom2 Megawad)", "summary": "doom2 maps", "version": "25.03.2005", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/img/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/29/Doom_II_-_Hell_on_Earth_Coverart.png", "author": "Erik Alm", "downloadCount": 447, "tags": ["doom2-maps-scythe2", "maps", "doom2", "wad"]}
