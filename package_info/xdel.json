{"description": "The NTFS filesystem of NT4/W2K/WXP supports the junction/symbolic link functionality. Deleting subdirectories recursivley can be done by various of tools, but only xdel is aware of junctions/symbolic link, and instead of crawling recursivley down a junction/symbolic link, xdel simply unlinks the junction/symbolic link, and so does no harm to contents chained into a hierarchy via junctions/symbolic link.\n\nFurthermore xdel.exe properly deletes very long pathnames with more than 256 characters. \n\n#### Manual\n\n`xdel.exe` is a typical command line utility.\n\nRecursivly delete directory hierarchies. e.g.:\n\n    `xdel x:\\dir\\dir2`\n\nIn the above example the directories and files below `x:\\dir\\dir2` are deleted.", "updated": "2024-03-04T21:48:23Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/xdel/5.3.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/xdel/5.3.0", "licenseUrl": "http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/xdel/license.txt", "packageName": "xdel", "displayName": "Xdel", "summary": "Delete subdirectories recursivley with support for junction/symbolic links", "version": "5.3.0", "icon": "", "author": "Hermann Schinagl", "downloadCount": 1038, "tags": ["cli", "hardlink", "freeware"]}
