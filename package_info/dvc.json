{"description": "**Data Version Control** or **DVC** is an **open-source** tool for data science and machine\nlearning projects. Key features:\n\n* Simple **command line** Git-like experience. Does not require installing and maintaining\n   any databases. Does not depend on any proprietary online services.\n\n* Management and versioning of **datasets** and **machine learning models**. Data is saved in\n   S3, Google cloud, Azure, Alibaba cloud, SSH server, HDFS, or even local HDD RAID.\n\n* Makes projects **reproducible** and **shareable**; helping to answer questions about how\n   a model was built.\n\n* Helps manage experiments with Git tags/branches and **metrics** tracking.\n\n**DVC** aims to replace spreadsheet and document sharing tools (such as Excel or Google Docs)\nwhich are being used frequently as both knowledge repositories and team ledgers.\nDVC also replaces both ad-hoc scripts to track, move, and deploy different model versions;\nas well as ad-hoc data file suffixes and prefixes.", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:33:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dvc/3.48.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/dvc/3.48.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/iterative/dvc/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "dvc", "displayName": "DVC", "summary": "Git for data scientists - manage your code and data together", "version": "3.48.2", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/iterative/dvc.org/87181d735a2d8cc5fcd3a22441db6169749d5012/static/img/logo-owl-readme.png", "author": "Dmitry Petrov", "downloadCount": 16814, "tags": ["dvc", "git", "ml", "ds", "cross-platform", "cli", "foss"]}
