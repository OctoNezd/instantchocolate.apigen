{"description": "Bitdefender USB Immunizer is a handy utility designed to allow users to immunize their USB storage devices or SD cards against infections with autorun-based malware.\nFor years, Autorun-based malware has been atop of the worldwide e-threat landscape, with notorious representatives such as Trojan.AutorunInf, the Conficker worm (Win32.Worm.Downadup) or Worm.Autorun.VHD.\nIntroduced back in the Windows XP era to facilitate software installations from CD-ROM media for non-technical computer users, the Autorun feature has rapidly become the infection vector of choice for cyber-criminals.\nBitdefender USB Immunizer is a response to this growing issue.\nIt disables autorun-related threats before they access the computer. Once installed, it constantly watches for newly inserted USB storage devices and immunizes them on the fly. If you accidentally plug in an infected USB drive that has not been immunized, the computer will not auto-execute the piece of malware located on the USB storage device.\n\nThe FAQ for the latest version of the USB Immunizer can be found [here](http://labs.bitdefender.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/FAQ.txt).", "updated": "2024-03-22T12:18:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/bitdefender-usb-immunizer/2.0.1.901", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/bitdefender-usb-immunizer/2.0.1.901", "licenseUrl": "http://labs.bitdefender.com/projects/usb-immunizer/overview/", "packageName": "bitdefender-usb-immunizer", "displayName": "Bitdefender USB Immunizer", "summary": "Bitdefender USB Immunizer is a handy utility designed to allow users to immunize their USB storage devices or SD cards against infections with autorun-based malware.", "version": "2.0.1.901", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages/9282e769979fbb235869051249a70d56517f4ff9/icons/bitdefender-usb-immunizer.png", "author": "Bitdefender SRL", "downloadCount": 7198, "tags": ["bitdefender-usb-immunizer", "bitdefender", "usb", "autorun", "immunizer", "anti-virus", "freeware"]}
