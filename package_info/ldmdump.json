{"description": "Windows 2000 introduces a new type of disk partitioning scheme that is managed by a component called the Logical Disk Manager (LDM). Basic disks implement standard DOS-style partition tables, whereas Dynamic disks use LDM partitioning. LDM partitioning offers several advantages over DOS partitioing including replication across disks, on-disk storage of advanced volume configuration (spanned volume, mirrored volumes, striped volumes and RAID-5 volumes). My March/April two-part series on Windows NT/2000 storage management in Windows 2000 Magazine describes the details of each partitioning scheme.\n\n#### Command line usage\n\nTo use _LDMDump_ simply pass it the identifier of a disk.\n\n__ldmdump [- ] [-d#]__\n__-__     Displays the supported options and the units of measurement used for output values.`\n\n__-d#__    Specifies the number of the disk for _LDMDump_ to examine. For example, \"ldmdump /d0\" has _LDMDump_ show the LDM database information stored on disk 0.`", "updated": "2024-03-22T16:18:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ldmdump/1.02", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ldmdump/1.02", "licenseUrl": "https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb469936", "packageName": "ldmdump", "displayName": "LDMDump", "summary": "Dump the contents of the Logical Disk Manager's on-disk database, which describes the partitioning of Dynamic disks", "version": "1.02", "icon": "", "author": "Mark Russinovich", "downloadCount": 1093, "tags": ["ldm", "partition", "disk", "sysinternals"]}
