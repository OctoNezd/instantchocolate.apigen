{"description": "***The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs and Vim!***\n\nSpacemacs is a new way to experience Emacs -- a sophisticated and polished set-up focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.\n\nJust clone it, launch it, then press the space bar to explore the interactive list of carefully-chosen key bindings. You can also press the home buffer's `[?]` button for some great first key bindings to try.\n\nSpacemacs can be used naturally by both Emacs and Vim users -- you can even mix the two editing styles. Switching easily between input styles makes Spacemacs a great tool for pair-programming.\n\nSpacemacs is currently in beta, and contributions are very welcome.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Great documentation:** access documentation in Emacs with `SPC h SPC`.\n- **Beautiful GUI:** you'll love the distraction free UI and its functional mode-line.\n- **Excellent ergonomics:** all the key bindings are accessible by pressing the `space bar` or `alt-m`.\n- **Mnemonic key bindings:** commands have mnemonic prefixes like `SPC b` for all the buffer commands or `SPC p` for the project commands.\n- **Batteries included:** discover hundreds of ready-to-use packages nicely organised in configuration layers following a set of [conventions](http://spacemacs.org/doc/CONVENTIONS).\n\n## Documentation\n\nComprehensive documentation is available for each layer by pressing `SPC h SPC`.\n\nYou can also check the [general documentation](http://spacemacs.org/doc/DOCUMENTATION), [quick start guide](http://spacemacs.org/doc/QUICK_START) and the [FAQ](http://spacemacs.org/doc/FAQ).\n\n## Getting Help\n\nIf you need help, ask your question in the [Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs) and a member of the community will help you out.\n\nIf you prefer IRC, connect to the [Gitter Chat IRC server](https://irc.gitter.im) and join the `#syl20bnr/spacemacs` channel.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### Emacs\n\nSpacemacs requires Emacs 24.4 or above. The development version of Emacs (at the time of writing, this is 25.2) is not *officially* supported, but should nevertheless be expected to work.\n\nSome modes require third-party tools that you'll have to install via your favorite package manager.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/spacemacs/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/spacemacs/0.200.13.20210130", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/spacemacs/0.200.13.20210130", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs#license", "packageName": "spacemacs", "displayName": "Spacemacs", "summary": "A community-driven Emacs distribution.", "version": "0.200.13.20210130", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/spacemacs/spacemacs.png", "author": "Sylvain Benner", "downloadCount": 4829, "tags": ["spacemacs", "emacs", "vim", "editor"]}
