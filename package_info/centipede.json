{"description": "![screen shot of Centipede](http://pjsfreeware.synthasite.com/resources/centi100.png)\n\n**************** Centipede Another classic game from atari. *****************\n\nThis game is freeware\nCentipede (c) PJ Crossley MMDCCLXIV\n\nThe Centipedes - consist of one or more attached segments which move horizontally through the playfield, moving one tile vertically when they hit the side of the screen, or a mushroom. Shoot a segment, and it will turn into a mushroom. If a centipede is split in half in this fashion, the segment behind the shot will form a head and you'll have two smaller centipedes to contend with. \nMushrooms - harmless to the touch, but take four shots to destroy. The player and centipedes can't move through them. \nPoison mushrooms - These don't kill anything. But, when a centipede hits a poison mushroom, they go straight down until they hit the bottom of the screen. \nSpiders - they come in from the side and scurry around the bottom half of the screen really fast, making wibbledy-wibbledy sounds. \nScorpions - they crawl through the top half of the screen and change mushrooms into poison mushrooms. \nFleas - they occasionally drop through the screen, leaving a trail of mushrooms.\n\n###Scoring:\n* extra life every 12000 points\n* Body segments 10pts\n* Head 100pts\n* Spider 300pts\n* Flea 200pts\n* Scorpian 1000pts\n\n###Controls:\n* Arrow keys to move\n* Ctrl to fire\n* You can also use the mouse to play set from startup page\n\nGM7\n\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/centipede/readme.md)**", "updated": "2024-03-20T16:33:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/centipede/2011.09.19", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/centipede/2011.09.19", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "centipede", "displayName": "Centipede (Portable)", "summary": "PJ Crossley's remake of the classic Centipede game.", "version": "2011.09.19", "icon": "http://pjsfreeware.synthasite.com/resources/Rendered5.jpg", "author": "PJ Crossley", "downloadCount": 948, "tags": ["pjcrossley", "centipede", "retro", "game", "portable"]}
