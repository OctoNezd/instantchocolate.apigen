{"description": "Why write another unit converter? There are plenty of them out there. Well, I couldn't find one that worked quite the way I wanted.\nWith ConvertAll, you can combine the units any way you want. If you want to convert from inches per decade, that's fine. Or from meter-pounds. Or from cubic nautical miles.
