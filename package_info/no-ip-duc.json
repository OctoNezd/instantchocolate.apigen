{"description": "Keep your current IP address in sync with your No-IP host or domain with the Dynamic Update Client (DUC). The dynamic DNS update client continually checks for IP address changes in the background and automatically updates the DNS at No-IP whenever it changes.\n\n## Features\n- **Secure Key Based Updates:** Our secure DUC does not resend your No-IP credentials each time it sends an IP address update, instead it sends a unique key for username and password for your specific Dynamic Update Client.\n- **Client Tracking:** This feature allows you to see a list of each location where you have DUC installed. You can also set each update Client ID to a custom name for example home, work, client name, etc to help keep track of each.\n- **Host Creation (Plus & Enhanced Users):** If you are an Enhanced Dynamic DNS or Plus Managed DNS customer, you are able to easily add hostnames directly from the Dynamic Update Client.\n- **Runs When Logged Out:** If your computer is running, your hostname will still be updated when your IP address changes.\n- **Notifications:** Receive notifications when a service is about to expire, or if we send out an important network update.", "updated": "2024-03-23T23:33:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/no-ip-duc/4.1.1.20170207", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/no-ip-duc/4.1.1.20170207", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "no-ip-duc", "displayName": "No-IP DUC (Dynamic Update Client)", "summary": "Keep your current IP address in sync with your No-IP host", "version": "4.1.1.20170207", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages/e10d54a324b6e69d75aaecd061772762d27c68ba/icons/no-ip-duc.png", "author": "No-IP", "downloadCount": 60462, "tags": ["no-ip-duc", "no-ip", "dns", "dyndns", "dynamic-dns", "admin"]}
