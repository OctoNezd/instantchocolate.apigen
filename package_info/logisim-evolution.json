{"description": "Logisim is an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.\nIt has been originally created by [Dr. Carl Burch](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) and actively developed until 2011.\nAfter this date the author focused on other projects, and recently the development has been officially stopped  [(see his message here)](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/retire-note.html).\n\nIn the meantime, people from a group of swiss institutes ([Haute \u00c9cole Sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e Bernoise](http://www.bfh.ch), [Haute \u00c9cole du paysage, d'ing\u00e9nierie et d'architecture de Gen\u00e8ve](http://hepia.hesge.ch), and [Haute \u00c9cole d'Ing\u00e9nierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud](http://www.heig-vd.ch)) started developing a version of Logisim that fitted their courses, integrating several tools -- for instance a chronogram, the possibility to test the schematics directly on an electronic board, TCL/TK consoles, ...\n\nThe project is currently maintained by the [REDS Institute](http://reds.heig-vd.ch), which is part of the [Haute \u00c9cole d'Ing\u00e9nierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud](http://www.heig-vd.ch), Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland.\n\nWe have decided to release this new Logisim version under the name logisim-evolution, to highlight the large number of changes that occurred in these years, and **we actively seek the contribution of the community**.\n\n## What's new in logisim-evolution\n* chronogram -- to see the evolution of signals in your circuit\n* electronic board integration -- schematics can now be simulated on real hardware!\n* board editor -- to add new electronic boards\n* VHDL component -- a new component type whose behavior is specified in VHDL\n* TCL/TK console -- interfaces between the circuit and the user\n* DIP switches\n* RGB LEDs\n* large number of bug-fixes\n* GUI improvements\n* automatic updates\n* code refactoring\n* ...\n\n## Testing logisim-evolution\nAs logisim-evolution needs updates (new features and patches) and currently lacks unit tests, the *testing* branch was created.\nThe goal of this branch is to add new features/patches without affecting the release on branch master.\nUsers who are willing test new features should checkout the testing branch. The feedback from users is really appreciated as it makes logisim-evolution better. Feel free to use the issue tab to report bugs and suggest features.\n\nThen every semester, the testing branch will be merged in the master for a new release.\n\n## Documentation\n[Here](http://reds-data.heig-vd.ch/logisim-evolution/IntroToLogisimEnglish.pdf) you can find a tutorial (French version [here](http://reds-data.heig-vd.ch/logisim-evolution/tutoLogisim.pdf)) that explains some basic usage of Logisim. The electronic card referenced in the tutorial is a small card we use in our laboratories -- you won't be able to buy it in a store -- but the descriptions should be good enough to be used for another generic board.\n\nAnother good reference is [this book](http://www.lulu.com/shop/george-self/exploring-digital-logic-with-logisim-ebook/ebook/product-21118223.html), where basic electronics is explained with the help of Logisim.\n\n## Development\nLogisim-evolution uses gradle for project management which means it can be easily imported into most modern IDEs.\n\nInstructions on how to import a gradle project into Eclipse can be found [here](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2018/february/buildship.php).\n\nInstructions on how to import a gradle project into IntelliJ IDEA can be found [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html) under \"Importing a project from a Gradle model\" title.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/logisim-evolution/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-22T08:48:51Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/logisim-evolution/3.8.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/logisim-evolution/3.8.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution/blob/master/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "logisim-evolution", "displayName": "Logisim Evolution", "summary": "Digital logic designer and simulator", "version": "3.8.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution.png", "author": "Carl Burch - Hendrix College - USA,  Haute \u00c9cole Sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e Bernoise - Switzerland,  Haute \u00c9cole du paysage,  d'ing\u00e9nierie et d'architecture de Gen\u00e8ve - Switzerland,  Haute \u00c9cole d'Ing\u00e9nierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud - Switzerland,  Theldo Cruz Franqueira - Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica de Minas Gerais - Brasil,  Moshe Berman - Brooklyn College", "downloadCount": 6025, "tags": ["logisim-evolution", "digital", "logic", "designer", "simulator"]}
