The following archives contain executable binaries that have been compiled and linked with OpenSSL. Only the DCMTK tools that make use of OpenSSL are included in these archives - please also download the corresponding full binary package. Please note that the use of cryptographic algorithms is affected by legislation and patent issues in many countries - you have to make sure yourself that you are allowed to use these tools before downloading them.
