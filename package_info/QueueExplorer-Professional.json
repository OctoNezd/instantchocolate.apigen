It comes with a 14 day trial.", "updated": "2024-03-21T20:33:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/QueueExplorer-Professional/3.3.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/QueueExplorer-Professional/3.3.1", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "QueueExplorer-Professional", "displayName": "QueueExplorer Professional", "summary": "Explorer-like MSMQ management", "version": "3.3.1", "icon": "", "author": "Dejan Grujic,  Marija Grujic", "downloadCount": 1931, "tags": ["QueueExplorer", "admin", "msmq", "trial"]}
