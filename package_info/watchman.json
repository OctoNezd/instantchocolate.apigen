{"description": "Watchman exists to watch files and record when they change. It can also trigger actions (such as\nrebuilding assets) when matching files change.\n\n## Features\n\n* Watchman can recursively watch one or more directory trees (they are called  roots)\n* Watchman does not follow symlinks. It knows they exist, but they show up the same as any other file in its reporting\n* Watchman waits for a root to settle down before it will start to trigger notifications or command execution\n* Watchman is conservative, preferring to err on the side of caution; it considers files to be freshly changed when you start to watch them or when it is unsure\n* You can query a root for file changes since you last checked, or the current state of the tree\n* You can subscribe to file changes that occur in a root\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@81ac243b44259eb52e3b16c908322bb1a0207810/automatic/watchman/screenshot.png)\n\n## Notes\n\n* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).\n  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-23T23:18:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/watchman/2024.03.11.00", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/watchman/2024.03.11.00", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/facebook/watchman/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "watchman", "displayName": "Watchman - A file watching service", "summary": "Watches files and records, or triggers actions, when they change", "version": "2024.03.11.00", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@81ac243b44259eb52e3b16c908322bb1a0207810/icons/watchman.png", "author": "Facebook", "downloadCount": 30149, "tags": ["watchman", "file-watch", "record", "trigger", "actions", "facebook"]}
