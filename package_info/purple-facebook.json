{"description": "Purple Facebook implements the Facebook Messenger protocol into pidgin, finch, and libpurple. While the primary implementation is for purple3, this plugin is back-ported for purple2.\n    \n      The purple-facebook plugin is a replacement for the builtin Facebook XMPP plugin. Facebook is in the process of shutting down their XMPP service, which will inevitably break existing support.\n\n      As part of Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2015, jgeboski worked on a plugin for libpurple to support the newer Facebook Messenger protocol. The plugin is implemented for the development version of libpurple, purple3, which has yet to be released. The purple-facebook project simply back-ports the purple3 plugin to purple2, which is the released version of libpurple.\n\n      As of October 18, 2015, jgeboski's GSoC work was merged into the mainline Pidgin project. It will appear in the next major release of Pidgin.\n      \n      https://github.com/jgeboski/purple-facebook/wiki\n      \n      **Notes from the Chocolatey package owner(s):\n      \n        -The purple-facebook project adds support for the Facebook Messenger protocol in pidgin, finch, and libpurple, but this Chocolatey package is for adding Facebook Messenger support for pidgin, specifically.", "updated": "2024-03-19T15:33:37Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/purple-facebook/0.9.6.166", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/purple-facebook/0.9.6.166", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "packageName": "purple-facebook", "displayName": "Purple Facebook", "summary": "Purple Facebook implements the Facebook Messenger protocol into pidgin, finch, and libpurple.", "version": "0.9.6.166", "icon": "", "author": "James Geboski", "downloadCount": 8513, "tags": ["purple", "facebook", "libpurple", "pidgin", "chat", "im"]}
