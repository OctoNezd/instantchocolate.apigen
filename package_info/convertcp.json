{"description": "CONVERTCP is a command line codepage converter.\n\n## Features\n\n- Converts stream or file character encodings.\n- Fully supports charsets such as single-byte code pages, UTF-8, UTF-16 LE/BE, UTF-32 LE/BE, and EBCDIC.\n- Is designed to process big files also.\n\n## Notes\n\n- It shall work on Windows XP onwards (tested on XP, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Windows 11).\n- The support is restricted by\n  1. the shared characters of both used code pages. If a read character has no equivalent the implementations of the used API functions decide if they\n     * either convert to the approximated ASCII character (e.g. \u0160 to S), or\n     * replace it with a default character (question mark or Unicode Replacement Character)\n  2. the maximum number of bytes used to represent a character. The table outputted using option /l indicates in the second column whether or not a code page can be used by CONVERTCP for input streams greater than 511MB (while all listed code pages can be used for output streams independent of their size).\n- It's a free and open source tool.", "updated": "2024-03-08T00:03:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/convertcp/6.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/convertcp/6.3", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metaworx/au-packages/master/convertcp/legal/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "convertcp", "displayName": "CONVERTCP", "summary": "CONVERTCP is a command line codepage converter and converts a stream of characters to another code page", "version": "6.3", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metaworx/au-packages/master/convertcp/convertcp.png", "author": "Steffen Illhardt", "downloadCount": 386, "tags": ["foss", "cli", "convert", "encoding", "codepage", "files", "streams"]}
