{"description": "__New builds from files.budman.pw; 64-bit only__\n\niPerf3 is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, buffers and protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP with IPv4 and IPv6). For each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and other parameters. This is a new implementation that shares no code with the original iPerf and also is not backwards compatible. iPerf was orginally developed by NLANR/DAST. iPerf3 is principally developed by ESnet / Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It is released under a three-clause BSD license.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/iperf3/3.16.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/iperf3/3.16.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esnet/iperf/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "iperf3", "displayName": "iPerf3", "summary": "iPerf3 - The TCP, UDP and SCTP network bandwidth measurement tool", "version": "3.16.0", "icon": "", "author": "Jon Dugan,  Seth Elliott,  Bruce A.
