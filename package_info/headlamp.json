{"description": "# Headlamp\n\nHeadlamp is an easy-to-use and extensible Kubernetes graphical UI.\n\nHeadlamp was created to be a Kubernetes UI that has the traditional functionality of other\nweb UIs/dashboards available (i.e. to list and view resources) as well as other features.\n\n## Features\n\n  * Vendor independent / generic Kubernetes UI\n  * Works in-cluster, or locally as a desktop app\n  * Multi-cluster\n  * Extensible through plugins\n  * UI controls reflecting user roles (no deletion/update if not allowed)\n  * Clean & modern UI\n  * Cancellable creation/update/deletion operations\n  * Logs, exec, and resource editor with documentation\n  * Read-write / interactive (actions based on permissions)\n\n### Accessing\n\nHeadlamp uses [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac) for checking\nwhether and how users can access resources. If you try Headlamp with a token that has very limited\npermissions, you may not be able to view your cluster resources correctly.\n\nSee the documentation on [how to easily get a Service Account token](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation#create-a-service-account-token) for your cluster.", "updated": "2024-03-23T18:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/headlamp/0.22.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/headlamp/0.22.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/headlamp/blob/main/LICENSE", "packageName": "headlamp", "displayName": "Headlamp", "summary": "An easy-to-use and extensible graphical UI for Kubernetes.", "version": "0.22.0", "icon": "http://rawcdn.githack.com/headlamp-k8s/headlamp/main/frontend/public/apple-touch-icon.png", "author": "Kinvolk", "downloadCount": 1751, "tags": ["headlamp", "kubernetes", "ui", "gui", "dashboard", "devops"]}
