{"description": "Equalizer APO is a parametric equalizer for Windows. It is implemented as an Audio Processing Object (APO) for the system effect infrastructure introduced with Windows Vista.\n\nFeatures:\n- virtually unlimited number of filters\n- works on any number of channels\n- very low latency, which makes it suited for interactive applications\n- low CPU usage\n\nRequirements:\n- Windows Vista or later (currently only Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 have been tested)\n- Sound card driver must support APOs (this includes most onboard sound drivers)\n- The application must not bypass the system effect infrastructure\n(possible by using special APIs like ASIO)\n\nEqualizer APO is best used in conjunction with Room EQ Wizard (http://www.hometheatershack.com/roomeq/ ), because it can read its filter text file format.\n\nPlease have a look at the Wiki (http://sourceforge.net/p/equalizerapo/wiki/) for instructions on installation and configuration.", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:33:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/equalizerapo/1.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/equalizerapo/1.2", "licenseUrl": "http://sourceforge.net/directory/license:gpl/", "packageName": "equalizerapo", "displayName": "Equalizer APO", "summary": "Equalizer APO is a parametric equalizer for Windows.
