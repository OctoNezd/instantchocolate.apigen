{"description": "## Features\n\nThis is a brief summary of what SciDAVis can do. If you are still unsure whether it meets your needs, you can also take a look at the screenshots or simply download SciDAVis and see for yourself!\n\n- Tables (2D data), matrices (3D data), graphs (2D or 3D plots) and notes (text notes or scripts) are gathered in a Project and can be organized using folders.\n- Data for tables or matrices can be entered directly or imported from ASCII files.\n- Cell values in tables can be computed using standard and special functions (and much more if you have Python installed). Each table cell can be assigned an individual formula.\n- Multi-level undo/redo for tables and matrices.\n- Many built-in analysis operations like column/row statistics, (de)convolution, FFT and FFT-based filters.\n- Extensive support for fitting linear and nonlinear functions to the data, including multi-peak fitting.\n- Publication-quality 2D plots of various types including symbols/lines, bars and pie charts which can be exported to a variety of formats (JPG, PNG, EPS, PDF, SVG and more).\n- Interactive 3D plots with export to a variety of formats, including EPS and PDF.\n- Note windows with support for in-place evaluation of mathematical expressions. With Python installed, you can even access other objects in the project, e.g. for rapidly writing an import filter for a custom data format.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/scidavis/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-22T23:33:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/scidavis/2.7", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/scidavis/2.7", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/highperformancecoder/scidavis/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "scidavis", "displayName": "SciDAVis", "summary": "SciDAVis is a free application for Scientific Data Analysis and Visualization.", "version": "2.7", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/scidavis/scidavis.png", "author": "SciDAVis Team.", "downloadCount": 2103, "tags": ["scidavis", "scientific", "data", "analysis", "visualization"]}
