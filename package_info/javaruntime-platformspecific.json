{"description": "**NOTE:** This package has been deprecated in favour of the jre8 package\n\nJava allows you to play online games, chat with people around the world, calculate your mortgage interest, and view images in 3D, just to name a few. It's also integral to the intranet applications and other e-business solutions that are the foundation of corporate computing.\n\n### Note\n\nThis package installs the Java version offered at https://www.java.com (currently Java 7). It also sets `SPONSORS=0` ([see docs](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/windows/jre-installer-options.html#running)).\n\nIf you want Java 8, install the [jre8](/packages/jre8) package instead.\n\nThis only installs the Java Runtime with the bitness specific to your OS (either 32- or 64-bit).
