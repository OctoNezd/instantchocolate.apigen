{"description": "# grap\nTypesets graphs to be processed by the pic command. \n\nThe **grap** command processes grap language input files and generates input to the pic command. The grap language is a language for typesetting graphs. A typical command line is:\n```\ngrap  File  |  pic  |  troff  |  Typesetter\n```\nGraphs are surrounded by the **.G1** and **.G2 troff** command requests. Data enclosed by these requests are scaled and plotted, with tick marks automatically supplied. Commands exist to modify the frame, add labels, override the default ticks, change the plotting style, define coordinate ranges and transformations, and include data from files. In addition, the grap command provides the same loops, conditionals, and macroprocessing as the pic command.\n\nGrap language files contain grap programs. A grap program is written in the form:\n```\n.G1\ngrap Statement\ngrap Statement\ngrap Statement\n.G2\n```", "updated": "2024-03-15T10:33:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/grap/1.45", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/grap/1.45", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/snorerot13/grap/blob/master/COPYRIGHT", "packageName": "grap", "displayName": "grap", "summary": "Typesets graphs to be processed by the pic command.", "version": "1.45", "icon": "", "author": "Ted Faber", "downloadCount": 102, "tags": ["typeset", "graph", "pic", "groff", "unix", "commandline"]}
