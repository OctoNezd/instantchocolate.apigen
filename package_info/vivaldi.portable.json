{"description": "It's a browser. But fun. It comes with a bunch of clever features built-in. It's freakishly flexible and private too.\n\n## What makes Vivaldi different?\n\n### More features, not less\n\nYou spend a lot of time in your browser. It should do everything you need out-of-the-box. Vivaldi comes with built-in features like Notes, Screen Capture, Image Properties and (a lot) more.\n\n### Everything's an option\n\nWe want Vivaldi to work for anyone so we give you options. Lots and lots of options. You choose how Vivaldi works, what features to use and how it looks. This is your browser, after all.\n\n### There are no rules\n\nHow your browser works is up to you. There are multiple ways to access and control most things in Vivaldi. Play around and find what works for you.\n\n### Your browser, your business\n\nBeing \u201cprivacy first\u201d is not something we say lightly. We don\u2019t track you. And we mean it. Nothing, zero, zilch. Making the browser is our job. How you use it is none of our business.\n\n**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vivaldi.portable/6.6.3271.53", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vivaldi.portable/6.6.3271.53", "licenseUrl": "https://vivaldi.com/privacy/vivaldi-end-user-license-agreement", "packageName": "vivaldi.portable", "displayName": "Vivaldi (Portable)", "summary": "It's a browser.
