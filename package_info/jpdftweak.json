{"description": "jPDF Tweak is a Java Swing application that can combine, split, rotate, reorder, watermark, encrypt, sign, and otherwise tweak PDF files.\n\nYou can use it to make printable booklets from your PDFs, to add PDF bookmarks, effects (page transitions), to combine multiple PDF files, to watermark them, to rotate pages that do not fit, to attach files to your PDF, to encrypt and sign your PDFs, to change metadata (like author or keywords), and much more.\n\nYou might want to have a look at the [manual](http://jpdftweak.sourceforge.net/manual/index.html).\n\njPDF Tweak uses the excellent [iText](http://www.lowagie.com/iText) library for manipulating PDF files, and [JGoodies Forms](http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/forms) for the GUI.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/jpdftweak/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-22T20:33:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/jpdftweak/1.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/jpdftweak/1.1", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt", "packageName": "jpdftweak", "displayName": "jPdf Tweak - Swiss Army Knife for PDF files", "summary": "jPDF Tweak is a Java Swing application that can combine, split, rotate, reorder, watermark, encrypt, sign, and otherwise tweak PDF files.", "version": "1.1", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/jpdftweak/jpdftweak.png", "author": "Michael Schierl,  Thanasis Naskos.", "downloadCount": 781, "tags": ["jpdftweak", "tool", "PDF"]}
