Do you need features like domain migration? Or support for paths longer than 260 character other tools cannot handle any more? In either case you have come to the right place.\n\nSetACL comes in two variants: one, a command-line tool, ideal for use in scripts and batch files. Two, a COM DLL that is perfect for basically any programming language. Both are free.\n\n### What does SetACL do?\n\nSetACL manages permissions, auditing and ownership information. It does everything the tools built into Windows do, and much more. It is inherently automatable and scriptable. The COM version provides the full functionality to any COM-enabled programming language (C#, Visual Basic, C++, Delphi, PowerShell, VBScript, \u2026).\n\nSetACL facilitates migrations, where re-acling is an essential step. It copies permissions between users or even domains. It can be used to hunt down unwanted permissions and mercilessly remove them. SetACL is the driving force in countless scripts, tested and proven. It is valued by administrators and developers alike. SetACL has been downloaded more than 400,000 times.\n\nRead about SetACL\u2019s [feature set](https://helgeklein.com/setacl/feature-set/).
