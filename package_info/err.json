{"description": "Use the Error Code Lookup tool to determine error values from decimal and hexadecimal error codes in Microsoft Windows\u00ae operating systems. The tool can look up one or more values at a time. All values on the command line will be looked up in the tool's internal tables (generated from Win32 API header files) and presented to you. If available, informational data associated with the value or values will also be shown. The tool is also able to show error codes associated with symbolic error names (e.g. E_FAIL).\n\nThis is a \"point-in-time\" tool. The Microsoft Error Lookup Tool decodes most Microsoft error codes as of the date on which the tool was compiled. As new releases of Windows add new event and error codes, you may have to download a new version of the Error Lookup Tool.\n\nRun \"err /?\" for usage instructions.", "updated": "2024-03-20T16:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/err/6.4.5.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/err/6.4.5.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement", "packageName": "err", "displayName": "Microsoft Error Lookup Tool", "summary": "Determine error values from decimal and hexadecimal error codes in Microsoft Windows\u00ae operating systems.", "version": "6.4.5.0", "icon": "", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 3133, "tags": ["error", "code", "hresult", "ntstatus", "lookup"]}
