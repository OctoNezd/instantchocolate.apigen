External file storage makes it easy to keep your repository at a manageable size.\n* **Faster cloning and fetching:** Download less data. This means faster cloning and fetching from repositories that deal with large files.\n* **Same Git workflow:** Work like you always do on Git-no need for additional commands, secondary storage systems, or toolsets.\n* **Same access controls and permissions:** Keep the same access controls and permissions for large files as the rest of your Git repository when working with a remote host like GitHub.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/git-lfs.install/3.5.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/git-lfs.install/3.5.1", "licenseUrl": "http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT", "packageName": "git-lfs.install", "displayName": "Git Large File Storage (Install)", "summary": "An open source Git extension for versioning large files", "version": "3.5.1", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages@e4982c6e79743c6da967833471a94d7b64c11464/icons/git-lfs.png", "author": "GitHub Inc", "downloadCount": 433831, "tags": ["git", "lfs", "vcs", "dvcs", "version-control", "admin", "foss", "cross-platform", "cli"]}
