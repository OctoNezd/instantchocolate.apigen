{"description": "# Cupscale\nImage Upscaling GUI based on ESRGAN\n\n![](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/jonasw234/au-packages/6e3023ac/cupscale/cupscale.png)\n\n## Credits:\nBased around [xinntao's ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN) implemented via [Joey's Fork](https://github.com/JoeyBallentine/ESRGAN).\n\nAMD/Intel GPU compatibility is possible thanks to BlueAmulet's [esrgan-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/BlueAmulet/realsr-ncnn-vulkan) based on nihui's [realsr-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/nihui/realsr-ncnn-vulkan) running on Tencent's [ncnn](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn) framework, as well as [xinntao's Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN).\n\n## Supported AI Backends:\n- Nvidia CUDA (Recommended)\n- Vulkan (Works on any modern GPU, but is slower and takes a long time start up)\n- CPU (Works without GPU, but is very slow)\n\n## Features:\n- CUDA, Vulkan/NCNN or CPU supported, with included model converter for NCNN\n- On-the-fly Model Interpolation\n- Model Chaining (Run images through multiple models at once)\n- Batch Upscaling (Load a directory or multiple single images)\n- Automatic Image tiling/merging to avoid running out of VRAM\n- Pre-Processing: Optionally downscale images before upscaling\n- Post-Processing: Automatically resize after upscaling\n- Compatible with PNG, JPEG, BMP, WEBP, TGA, DDS images\n- Load image straight out of the clipboard (no need to download images from web)\n- Create various types of comparisons (Side-By-Side, 50/50, and before/after animations as GIF or MP4)\n\n*To change the installation directory* use the parameter `--params \"/InstallDir:C:\\your\\install\\path\"`.  Temporary files are stored in the installation directory by default, which is why you shouldn\u2019t install the application in protected locations like Program Files.\n*Please Note:* This is an automatically updated package.
