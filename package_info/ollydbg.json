{"description": "OllyDbg is a 32-bit assembler level analysing debugger for Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae. Emphasis on binary code analysis makes it particularly useful in cases where source is unavailable. OllyDbg is a shareware, but you can download and use it for free.\n\n###\tSpecial highlights are:\n\n- Intuitive user interface, no cryptical commands\n- Code analysis - traces registers, recognizes procedures, loops, API calls, switches, tables, constants and strings\n- Directly loads and debugs DLLs\n- Object file scanning - locates routines from object files and libraries\n- Allows for user-defined labels, comments and function descriptions\n- Understands debugging information in Borland\u00ae format\n- Saves patches between sessions, writes them back to executable file and updates fixups\n- Open architecture - many third-party plugins are available\n- No installation - no trash in registry or system directories\n- Debugs multithread applications\n- Attaches to running programs\n- Configurable disassembler, supports both MASM and IDEAL formats\n- MMX, 3DNow! and SSE data types and instructions, including Athlon extensions\n- Full UNICODE support\n- Dynamically recognizes ASCII and UNICODE strings - also in Delphi format!\n- Recognizes complex code constructs, like call to jump to procedure\n- Decodes calls to more than 1900 standard API and 400 C functions\n- Gives context-sensitive help on API functions from external help file\n- Sets conditional, logging, memory and hardware breakpoints\n- Traces program execution, logs arguments of known functions\n- Shows fixups\n- Dynamically traces stack frames\n- Searches for imprecise commands and masked binary sequences\n- Searches whole allocated memory\n- Finds references to constant or address range\n- Examines and modifies memory, sets breakpoints and pauses program on-the-fly\n- Assembles commands into the shortest binary form\n- Starts from the floppy disk", "updated": "2024-03-23T23:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ollydbg/1.10", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ollydbg/1.10", "licenseUrl": "http://www.ollydbg.de/download.htm", "packageName": "ollydbg", "displayName": "OllyDbg", "summary": "", "version": "1.10", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/Spacewalker2/chocolatey-packages/master/Icons/OllyDbg.png", "author": "Oleh Yuschuk", "downloadCount": 14547, "tags": ["reverse", "engineering", "debugger", "disassembler", "binary", "analysis"]}
