{"description": "#### New package name: __[cmdermini](https://chocolatey.org/packages/cmdermini)__\n\n- - -\n\n`cmdermini.portable` has been deprecated because of Chocolatey Community [Naming Conventions](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CreatePackages#naming-your-package). Community packages with an ID ending in `.install`/`.portable` are intended to indicate there are two possible methods for installing a program. If a user comes across one of these ID endings, it is expected an associated package with the corresponding ID ending also exists. The program `cmdermini` only provides a portable method so the simplest ID should be used.\n\nThis package exists only for backward compatibility to provide a transitional, empty dummy package for existing users and scripts which may still use this package ID.", "updated": "2024-03-10T11:33:34Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/cmdermini.portable/1.1.4.102", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/cmdermini.portable/1.1.4.102", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "cmdermini.portable", "displayName": "[DEPRECATED] CmderMini (Portable)", "summary": "Portable console emulator", "version": "1.1.4.102", "icon": "", "author": "Samuel Vasko", "downloadCount": 5995, "tags": ["deprecated"]}
