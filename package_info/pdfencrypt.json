{"description": "PDFEncrypt is a free, simple, open-source utility to encrypt PDF files using standard PDF encryption algorithms.  When a document is encrypted, its contents become unreadable. An authorized user can decrypt the document to obtain access to the contents. If a PDF document is encrypted with a password, the user must specify the password before the document can be viewed in many PDF readers (e.g. Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat among others).", "updated": "2024-03-15T21:04:05Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pdfencrypt/1.1.8461.14277", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pdfencrypt/1.1.8461.14277", "licenseUrl": "https://pdfencrypt.net/license/", "packageName": "pdfencrypt", "displayName": "PDFEncrypt", "summary": "Password protect (encrypt) PDF files for free.", "version": "1.1.8461.14277", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages@c335fe815c8ee406c166cc4d00252032147911a4/Icons/pdfencrypt_icon.png", "author": "Ryan Griggs", "downloadCount": 356, "tags": ["pdfencrypt", "pdf", "encryption", "FOSS", "embedded"]}
