{"description": "# fpt - Flexera Policy Tool\n\n`fpt` is a command line tool to aid in the development and testing of [RightScale Policies](https://docs.rightscale.com/policies/). The tool is able to syntax check, upload, and run Policies.\n\n### Configuration\n\n`fpt` interfaces with the [Policy API](https://reference.rightscale.com/governance-policies/). Credentials for the API can be provided in two ways:\n\n1. YAML-based configuration file -  Run `fpt config account <name>`, where name is a nickname for the account, to interactively write the configuration file into `$HOME/.fpt.yml` for the first time. You will be prompted for the following fields:\n    * Account ID - Numeric account number, such as `60073`\n    * API endpoint host - Hostname, typically `governance-3.rightscale.com`\n    * Refresh Token - Your personal OAuth token available from **Settings > Account Settings > API Credentials** in the RightScale Cloud Management dashboard\n2. Environment variables - These are meant to be used by build systems such as Travis CI. The following vars must be set: `FPT_LOGIN_ACCOUNT_ID`, `FPT_LOGIN_ACCOUNT_HOST`, `FPT_LOGIN_ACCOUNT_REFRESH_TOKEN`. These variables are equivalent to the ones described in the YAML section above.\n\n**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package.
