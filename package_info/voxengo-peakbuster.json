{"description": "Peakbuster is an attack-phase boosting and harmonic enhancement AU, AAX, and VST plugin for professional music and sound production applications.  Peakbuster is a multi-band transient enhancer effect plug-in that uses an advanced automatic algorithm.  Peakbuster stands out from the competition in its ability to always sound natural, even on a full-spectrum master bus.  The strength of the effect depends on the material being processed: the algorithm masterfully analyses dynamics of the sound it processes, and applies boosting in quantities that are \u201cexactly right\u201d.  Moreover, the algorithm has a suitably \u201cfast\u201d reaction time making its adjustments sound \u201cfluid\u201d, not \u201cover the place\u201d.\n\n## Package Specific\n\n### Package Parameters\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n * `/NoVst2x86`       - Do not install the x86 VST2 version\n * `/NoVst2x64`       - Do not install the x64 VST2 version\n * `/NoVst3x86`       - Do not install the x86 VST3 version\n * `/NoVst3x64`       - Do not install the x64 VST3 version\n * `/NoAaxx86`        - Do not install the x86 AAX version\n * `/NoAaxx64`        - Do not install the x64 AAX version\n * `/NoShortcuts`     - Do not install shortcuts to manuals and uninstaller into start menu or onto desktop\n * `/Vst2Path:`       - Installation path of the VST2 version\n * `/Vst2x86Path:` - Installation path of the x86 VST2 version on x64 CPU architecture\n * `/InstallerPath:`  - Do not download the installer from the official Voxengo website and use the one passed with this argument instead.
