The SQL Server PowerShell Provider delivers a simple mechanism for navigating SQL Server instances that is similar to file system paths. PowerShell scripts can then use the SQL Server Management Objects to administer the instances. The SQL Server cmdlets support operations such as executing Transact-SQL scripts or evaluating SQL Server policies.", "updated": "2024-03-22T21:33:45Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/SQL2008R2.PowerShell/10.50.1600.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/SQL2008R2.PowerShell/10.50.1600.1", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "SQL2008R2.PowerShell", "displayName": "Microsoft Windows PowerShell Extensions for SQL Server", "summary": "Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Feature Pack, October 2011\n\n      The Microsoft Windows PowerShell Extensions for SQL Server2008 R2 includes a provider and a set of cmdlets that enable administrators and developers to build PowerShell scripts for managing instances of SQL Server.
