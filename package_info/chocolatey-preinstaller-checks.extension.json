This extension will start working automatically once installed and does NOT need to be implemented by package creators/maintainers. **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** is meant to be installed and used directly by Chocolatey end users.\n\n### PURPOSE:\n\nThis extension attempts to head off problems related to:\n\n* [https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/544](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/544)\n* [https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/619](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/619)\n* [https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/761](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/761)\n* [https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/780](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/780)\n* [https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1526](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1526)\n* [https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1548](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1548)\n* [https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1579](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1579)\n* and possibly others until such time that Chocolatey natively handles these issues better and this extension becomes moot. (Rumored to be 1.0.0 milestone)\n\n**Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension**'s main purpose is to fend off specific types of problems before they occur. Currently Chocolatey (choco.exe) is not multi-instance friendly. If you try to install or uninstall packages using choco.exe in two Command Prompts at the same time, strange (bad!) things may occur. **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** can avoid these strange (bad!) things by intercepting calls to install and uninstall programs and warn about the situation, wait for previous instances to finish, or abort; totally configurable. **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** also checks Windows Installer to see if it's busy and will warn, make MSI installer and uninstaller programs wait until Windows Installer has finished processing the other program, or abort. **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** only runs before PROGRAM installations and uninstallations. It does not perform any functions related to portable packages or other choco commands.\n\n### FEATURES: \n* **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** is completely configurable to warn, wait, or abort.\n* **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** will check if there is a pending reboot and warn you about it if so.\n* **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** will check if Windows Installer is already running and warn, wait for it to finish, or abort.\n* **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** will check if there are instances of choco.exe already running and warn, wait for it to finish, or abort.\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/chocolatey-preinstaller-checks.extension_extras/readme.md)**\n\n---\n\nIf you **chocolatey-preinstaller-checks** useful, please consider donating:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/bcurran3donations or become a patron at https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3\n\n---", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey-preinstaller-checks.extension/0.0.2.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/chocolatey-preinstaller-checks.extension/0.0.2.2", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html", "packageName": "chocolatey-preinstaller-checks.extension", "displayName": "Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension", "summary": "Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension is a collection of helpers that check for possible unwanted conditions before installing and uninstalling Chocolatey packages.", "version": "0.0.2.2", "icon": "https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/mylogos/myunofficialChocolateylogo_icon.png", "author": "Bill Curran", "downloadCount": 50733, "tags": ["bcurran3", "unofficial", "choco", "pre", "installer", "uninstaller", "checks", "extension"]}
