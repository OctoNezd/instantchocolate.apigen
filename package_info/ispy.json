{"description": "iSpy is the world\u2019s most popular open source video surveillance application. It's compatible with the the vast majority of consumer webcams and IP cameras. With more than 2 million users worldwide, iSpy works with more cameras and devices than anything else on the market.\n\nThe number one use of iSpy is small business security, but home monitoring, neighborhood watch, checking in on the kids, desktop monitoring and mobile access through a iSpyConnect.com are valued features.\n\nFacial recognition and detection of changes in lighting and audio offer the subtleties that set the software apart from competitors.\n\nGetting started with iSpy is easy: all you need is a webcam or IP camera connected to your computer or network.\n\niSpy connects to the camera and shows the live view. You can then define specific areas of the video that iSpy should watch for movement, and set a threshold value for the amount of motion that would trigger automatic recording.\n\niSpy was designed to provide a low-cost alternative to expensive surveillance systems. It has become a highly scalable application that can be tailored to record and take actions on specific incidents as defined by the user either locally or remotely.\n\n## Discontinued\niSpyConnect started a [new platform to replace iSpy called Agent](https://www.ispyconnect.com/features.aspx) which runs as a service and has a full local and remote UI that works on all devices and doesn't require port forwarding for remote access. Agent has all the features of iSpy plus a lot more.", "updated": "2024-03-22T17:48:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ispy/7.2.6", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ispy/7.2.6", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/ispysoftware/iSpy/blob/master/lgpl-3.0.txt", "packageName": "ispy", "displayName": "iSpy", "summary": "Open source camera security software", "version": "7.2.6", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ispysoftware/iSpy@5fae6383d7aff3209114395870563c8ae7a98d2b/Resources/ispy.png", "author": "iSpyConnect", "downloadCount": 2525, "tags": ["ispy", "camera", "security", "surveillance", "webcams", "cams", "foss", "embedded"]}
