{"description": "Disk2vhd is a utility that creates VHD (Virtual Hard Disk - Microsoft's Virtual Machine disk format) versions of physical disks for use in Microsoft Virtual PC or Microsoft Hyper-V virtual machines (VMs).\n\nThe difference between Disk2vhd and other physical-to-virtual tools is that you can run Disk2vhd on a system that's online.\n\nDisk2vhd uses Windows' Volume Snapshot capability, introduced in Windows XP, to create consistent point-in-time snapshots of the volumes you want to include in a conversion.\n\nYou can even have Disk2vhd create the VHDs on local volumes, even ones being converted (though performance is better when the VHD is on a disk different than ones being converted).", "updated": "2024-03-23T21:18:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/disk2vhd/2.02", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/disk2vhd/2.02", "licenseUrl": "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/license-terms", "packageName": "disk2vhd", "displayName": "Disk2vhd", "summary": "Disk2vhd simplifies the migration of physical systems into virtual machines (p2v)", "version": "2.02", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/jpruskin/ChocolateyPackages/master/icons/disk2vhd.png", "author": "Mark Russinovich", "downloadCount": 6768, "tags": ["vhd", "vhdx", "converter", "virtualbox", "vmware", "sysinternals", "gui", "admin"]}
