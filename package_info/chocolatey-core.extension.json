{"description": "This is a extension package that provides helper functions installed as a Chocolatey extension.\nThese functions may be used in Chocolatey install/uninstall scripts by declaring this package a dependency in your package's nuspec.\nThis package provides helper functions that can be used to enhance what is already available out of the box with Chocolatey CLI.\nThis includes both features that are being tested for Chocolatey CLI itself, and other helpers to make the maintenance of\nChocolatey packages easier.\n\nHelpers that were available in this package, and were later added to Chocolatey CLI, will be moved to\nthe package [chocolatey-compatibility.extension](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey-compatibility.extension).\n\nBackwards compatibility is not considered for helpers available in this package, see the Notes below.\n\n## Notes\n\n- There is [a known bug](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-extensions/issues/11) in the function `Get-AppInstallLocation` with parameter `$AppNamePattern` which is internally used both as wildcard and regex patterns. This usually doesn't create any problems, but may do so if application contains regex symbols in the name, such as [notepad++](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-coreteampackages/issues/1198).\n- This package itself is not concerned with keeping backwards compatibility with Chocolatey CLI. If compatibility is of concern, instead take a dependency on [chocolatey-compatibility.extension](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey-compatibility.extension).", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey-core.extension/1.4.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/chocolatey-core.extension/1.4.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-extensions/blob/master/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "chocolatey-core.extension", "displayName": "Chocolatey Core Extensions", "summary": "Helper functions extending core choco functionality", "version": "1.4.0", "icon": "", "author": "chocolatey", "downloadCount": 58094449, "tags": ["chocolatey", "core", "extension", "admin"]}
