Any other chrome windows would \nstay on a single desktop. If you were to `pin application` on a chrome window then \nall chrome windows would show up on all desktops. This includes new chrome windows.\n\n## System Tray Icon  \n- Choose from several sets of icons  \n- The icons indicate which desktop you are viewing  \n- `Left-Click` the system tray icon to display or hide DesktopView.  \n- `Right-Click` the system tray icon to bring up the main menu.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/zvirtualdesktop/screenshot1.png)\n\nMake your own icons and attach them to an issue then they will add to the program.  \n[How to submit icon files](https://github.com/mzomparelli/zVirtualDesktop/issues/23)\n\nDownload the current icons and alter ones you like.  \n[Icons.zip](https://github.com/mzomparelli/zVirtualDesktop/blob/master/zVirtualDesktop/Icons.zip?raw=true)\n\n## Wallpapers  \n- Set a different wallpaper for each desktop  \n- Specify the style for each (Center, Stretch, or Tile)\n\n## Desktop Names  \n- Rename desktops directly in DesktopView or in the settings window   \n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/zvirtualdesktop/screenshot2.gif)\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/zvirtualdesktop/screenshot3.gif)", "updated": "2024-03-23T08:18:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/zvirtualdesktop/1.0.98.14", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/zvirtualdesktop/1.0.98.14", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "zvirtualdesktop", "displayName": "zVirtualDesktop", "summary": "Windows 10 Virtual Desktop Hotkeys and System Tray Icon", "version": "1.0.98.14", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/zvirtualdesktop/packageDefaultIcon.png", "author": "Michael Zomparelli", "downloadCount": 4148, "tags": ["zvirtualdesktop", "virtual", "desktop", "hotkey", "system", "tray", "icon", "trial"]}
