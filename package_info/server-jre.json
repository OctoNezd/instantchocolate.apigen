{"description": "Server JRE (Server Java Runtime Environment) for deploying Java applications on servers. Includes tools for JVM monitoring and tools commonly required for server applications, but does not include browser integration (the Java plug-in), auto-update, nor an installer.\n\n### Note\n\nThis is just a metapackage for the latest Server JRE (currently Server JRE 8). Have a look at the [server-jre8 package](/packages/server-jre8) for more details.\n\n### Parameters (for server-jre8)\n\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n * `/InstallationPath` - Install to a different destination folder. Default: `C:\\tools\\Java\\server-jre`\n * `/Force` - Force setting JAVA_HOME to the new version even if the variable was already set\n * `/Machine` - Set JAVA_HOME and PATH on 'Machine' level, instead of 'User' level\n\nThese parameters can be passed to the installer with the use of `--packageParameters` but since these parameters\ndon't directly affect the virtual package, we need to add `--paramsglobal` to pass them to the target/dependent server-jre8.\n\nFor example: `choco install server-jre --paramsglobal --packageParameters '\"/InstallationPath:C:\\tools\\Java /Force /Machine\"'`.", "updated": "2024-03-23T04:48:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/server-jre/8.0.192", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/server-jre/8.0.192", "licenseUrl": "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html", "packageName": "server-jre", "displayName": "Server JRE (Java SE Runtime Environment)", "summary": "The Server JRE includes tools for JVM monitoring and tools commonly required for server applications, but does not include browser integration (the Java plug-in).", "version": "8.0.192", "icon": "http://cdn.rawgit.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages/50fd97744110dcbce1acde889c0870599c9d5584/icons/java.svg", "author": "Oracle", "downloadCount": 34071, "tags": ["java", "server", "runtime", "environment", "jre", "admin"]}
