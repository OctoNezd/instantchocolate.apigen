{"description": "Log Parser Lizard is the best GUI for MS Logparser. Log Parser is a very powerful and versatile query software tool that provides universal query access (using SQL) to text-based data, such as log files, XML files, and CSV files, as well as key data sources on the Microsoft Windows operating system, such as the event log, IIS log, the registry, the file system and the Active Directory services.\n Because the command-line interface is not very intuitive, we have created Log Parser Lizard, a FREE GUI tool for managing queries and exporting results to Excel and charts. In addition, we have added input filters for RegEx and log4net input log formats (with support for regular expressions) and SQL server T-SQL queries. There are some helpful examples included in the installation package to help you start using Log Parser Lizard  as your query software,web log analyzer and system log analyzer.", "updated": "2024-03-19T12:18:39Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/logparser.lizardgui/6.8", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/logparser.lizardgui/6.8", "licenseUrl": "http://www.lizard-labs.net/log_parser_lizard.aspx", "packageName": "logparser.lizardgui", "displayName": "LogParser.LizardGui", "summary": "View and analyze your Log Files", "version": "6.8", "icon": "https://raw.github.com/jivkok/Chocolatey-Packages/master/LogParser.LizardGui/logparser.lizardgui.png", "author": "Lizard Labs", "downloadCount": 11703, "tags": ["logparser", "gui", "log", "parser", "eventlog", "registry", "ad", "wmi", "syslog", "logparser.lizardgui"]}
