{"description": "ConEmu is a beast to configure with reasonable defaults.\n\nIt is hands down the best terminal Windows has to offer, but its configuration\nabilities are overwhelming.  It also has a rather peculiar set of defaults, that\ncan make keyboard usage quite odd.\n\nThis pkg removes the pain.\n\nIncludes:\n - Uses Chris Kempson's base16 color scheme for hackers\n   https://github.com/chriskempson/base16\n - Uses long console output buffer height to ensure capturing all terminal output\n   from long running scripts\n - Smaller window chrome to save on screen real estate\n - Auto-updates enabled\n - Support for Ruby ANSI escape sequences through ConEmuHk\n - Block cursor\n - A simplified status bar\n - Sane key bindings that are consistent with other applications, for instance\n   - Windows + # are not hijacked, and Alt-1 through Alt-0 can switch tabs\n   - Ctrl-Tab cycles all tabs and current tab is always previewd\n   - Ctrl-W / Ctrl-F4 closes a tab\n   - Alt-Space shows ConEmu System menu\n   - Ctrl-T / Ctrl-N / Ctrl-Shift-N to create new tabs (mimicking Chrome)\n   - Ctrl-Shift-P to show tab context menu (mimicking Sublime)\n   - F11 full screen\n   - Ctrl-V pastes entire clipboard without prompting\n - Full mouse and keyboard selection support\n - Dim window on inactive\n\nI'm sure there are a couple of other minor tweaks that were dialed in as well.", "updated": "2024-03-15T23:33:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/JayHankins.ConEmuConfig/0.0.8", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/JayHankins.ConEmuConfig/0.0.8", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.github.com/jay-hankins/ChocolateyPackages/master/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "JayHankins.ConEmuConfig", "displayName": "JayHankins.ConEmuConfig", "summary": "ConEmu configured with Base16 color scheme and sane defaults, customized to Jay's liking..", "version": "0.0.8", "icon": "https://github.com/jay-hankins/ChocolateyPackages/raw/master/JayHankins.ConEmuConfig/conemu_logo.png", "author": "Jay Hankins", "downloadCount": 3696, "tags": ["conemu", "powershell", "git"]}
