{"description": "This project aims to provide common psake and Invoke-Build tasks for building, testing, and publishing PowerShell modules.\n\nUsing these shared tasks reduces the boilerplate scaffolding needed in most PowerShell module projects and help enforce a consistent module structure. This consistency ultimately helps the community in building high-quality PowerShell modules.\n\nYou can pass the following parameters:\n\n* `/core`     - Installs the module in the AllUsers scope for PowerShell Core;\n* `/desktop`  - Installs the module in the AllUsers scope for Windows PowerShell (ie. Desktop Edition);\n\nYou can pass both `/core` and `/desktop` parameters to install on both. If you pass no parameters then `/desktop` is assumed.\n\n_**NOTE: This module required at least PowerShell v3.**_\n\n**NOTE: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.**", "updated": "2024-03-09T04:33:20Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/powershellbuild.powershell/0.6.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/powershellbuild.powershell/0.6.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/psake/PowerShellBuild/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "powershellbuild.powershell", "displayName": "PowerShellBuild (PowerShell Module)", "summary": "This project aims to provide common psake and Invoke-Build tasks for building, testing, and publishing PowerShell modules.", "version": "0.6.1", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/pauby/ChocoPackages/09a4ba9b4dbfd187b39139f0d9f9b25965868279/icons/powershellbuild.powershell.png", "author": "Brandon Olin", "downloadCount": 1277, "tags": ["admin", "powershellbuild", "psake", "invokebuild", "powershell", "module"]}
