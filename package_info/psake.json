{"description": "psake is a build automation tool written in PowerShell. It avoids the angle-bracket tax associated with executable XML by leveraging the PowerShell syntax in your build scripts. psake has a syntax inspired by rake (aka make in Ruby) and bake (aka make in Boo), but is easier to script because it leverages your existent command-line knowledge. psake is pronounced sake - as in Japanese rice wine. It does NOT rhyme with make, bake, or rake. You can also install with chocolatey (http://nuget.org/List/Packages/chocolatey) and have global psake.", "updated": "2024-03-23T14:48:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/psake/4.9.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/psake/4.9.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psake/psake/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "psake", "displayName": "psake", "summary": "psake is a build automation tool written in PowerShell", "version": "4.9.0", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psake/graphics/master/png/psake-single-icon-teal-bg-256x256.png", "author": "James Kovacs", "downloadCount": 81232, "tags": ["build", "powershell"]}
