Many of them are commercial, proprietary-licensed and almost none of them support all major operating systems at the same time.\n\nHelio is an attempt to rethink a music sequencer to create a tool that **feels right**.\n\nIt aims to be a modern music creation software, featuring linear-based sequencer with a clean interface, high-performance C++ core, integrated version control providing intelligent synchronization between devices, saved undo history, translations to many languages and more.\n\n**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is\nout of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and\nlet them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-20T09:48:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/helio-workstation.portable/3.11", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/helio-workstation.portable/3.11", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/helio-fm/helio-workstation/blob/develop/LICENSE", "packageName": "helio-workstation.portable", "displayName": "Helio Workstation (Portable)", "summary": "One music sequencer for all major platforms, desktop and mobile", "version": "3.11", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mkevenaar/chocolatey-packages@04dc5eb5743f7aec66c0fd7a583fe56cb80aa51a/icons/helio-workstation.png", "author": "Peter Rudenko", "downloadCount": 1609, "tags": ["helio-workstation", "helio"]}
