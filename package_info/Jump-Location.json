{"description": "If you spend any time in a console you know that `cd` is by far the most common command that you issue. I'll open up a console to it's default location in `C:\\Users\\tkellogg` or `C:\\Windows\\system32` and then issue a `cd C:\\work\\MyProject`. `Set-JumpLocation` is a cmdlet lets you issue a `j my` to jump directly to `C:\\work\\MyProject`.\n\nIt learns your behavior by keeping track of how long you spend in certain directories and favoring them over the ones you don't care about. You don't have to use `Jump-Location` as a replacement for `cd`. Use `cd` to go local, and use `Set-JumpLocation` to jump further away.\n\n`Jump-Location` is a PowerShell implementation of autojump.\n\n**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-22T06:48:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/Jump-Location/0.6.0.20180509", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/Jump-Location/0.6.0.20180509", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/tkellogg/Jump-Location/blob/master/License.md", "packageName": "Jump-Location", "displayName": "Jump.Location (PowerShell Module)", "summary": "Jump.Location learns your behavior by keeping track of how long you spend in certain directories and favoring them over the ones you don't care about.", "version": "0.6.0.20180509", "icon": "", "author": "Tim Kellogg", "downloadCount": 5451, "tags": ["admin", "powershell", "module", "jump", "location", "ps", "autojump"]}
