By default, it is not encrypted. If you want to avoid risk, use master password.\n#### WebDAV server doesn't support user authentication or SSL/TLS.\nSince WebDAV server of CarotDAV is designed for local use, it becomes dangerous if the settings are wrong. Use loopback address(127.0.0.1) to prevent access from others.\n#### During OAuth procedure, CarotDAV shows the other site.\nSome services needs HTTPS server during OAuth. Since this site doesn't support HTTPS, CarotDAV use this page instead. I assure that site is safe in the same way as CarotDAV.\n\n### About Privacy\nCarotDAV accesses version file to confirm update on boot. Below informations are logged on the server at that time.\n- Current version of CarotDAV you use.\n- Access Time.\n- IP Address.\nI keep these logs not to be seen from others as possible. I might use or public these information after statistical processing. I might show these logs to public institution if they claim.\n\nCarotDAV collect no other information.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/carotdav.portable/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-22T20:03:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/carotdav.portable/1.16.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/carotdav.portable/1.16.3", "licenseUrl": "http://rei.to/carotdav_en.html#license", "packageName": "carotdav.portable", "displayName": "CarotDAV (Portable)", "summary": "CarotDAV is a Simple WebDAV / FTP / SFTP / Online Storages client for Windows OS, available free of charge.
