PsFile is a command-line utility that shows a list of files on a system that are opened remotely, and it also allows you to close opened files either by name or by a file identifier.\n\n#### Command line usage\n\nThe default behavior of _PsFile_ is to list the files on the local system that are open by remote systems. Typing a command followed by \"- \" displays information on the syntax for the command.\n\n__psfile [\\\\RemoteComputer [-u Username [-p Password]]] [[Id | path] [-c]]__\n\n__-u__    Specifies optional user name for login to remote computer.`\n\n__-p__    Specifies password for user name.
