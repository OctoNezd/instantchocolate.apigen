{"description": "# Summary\nThis tool creates a decrypted SQLite backup file of the `Cookies` file in the Chrome [User Data](https://www.chromium.org/user-experience/user-data-directory) Profile folder, using the credentials of the logged on user's profile. The tool can restore from this backup file back into a Chrome User Profile `Cookies` using a different user account or domain or Windows installation, by re-encrypting the data using the other user's credentials.\n\n# Usage\n\n1. Run `ChromeCookieBackup.exe` using the Windows user account of the source user/computer and save a backup file\n2. Move the `User Data` folder in its entirety to a different user account or Windows installation, or simply create a new profile on the target computer.\n3. Run the tool on the target computer using the target user account, and restore the backup to the desired Chrome profile(s). You may map Chrome profiles from the backup file to profiles on the target computer.\n\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/Marcus-L/chrome-cookie-backup/raw/master/ChromeCookieBackup/screenshot.png)\n\n## Notes:\n* Chromium implementation of Encrypted Cookies: https://codereview.chromium.org/24734007\n* DPAPI .NET Wrapper System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData docs: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.protecteddata(v=vs.110).aspx", "updated": "2024-03-06T18:18:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chromecookiebackup/1.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/chromecookiebackup/1.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/Marcus-L/chrome-cookie-backup/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "chromecookiebackup", "displayName": "ChromeCookieBackup", "summary": "A Windows Tool for backing up and restoring Chrome's encrypted cookies", "version": "1.0.0", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marcus-L/chrome-cookie-backup/master/ChromeCookieBackup/cookie.png", "author": "Marcus Lum", "downloadCount": 834, "tags": ["chrome", "cookie", "backup"]}
