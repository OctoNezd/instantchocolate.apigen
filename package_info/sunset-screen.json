{"description": "SunsetScreen is a Windows app which helps take the glare off your your screen in the evening. Scientific research has shown that melatonin - the chemical the brain makes late in the day - is reduced when exposed to blue light. By tempering this blue light, it becomes easier to wind down properly at night, and thus have a more restful sleep.\n\nWhether you're a morning lark or night owl, SunsetScreen allows you to set the time of the sunset and sunrise, so you can have full control over your sleep cycle.\n\n## Features\n- Set the sunset time precisely.\n- Set the sunrise time too.\n- Choose by colour temperature or by HSB for a precise colour.\n- Transition from one phase to the other gradually.\n- Automatically resides in the tray so it keeps out of your way.\n- Loads automatically at Windows startup if you wish.\n- Instantly turn off SunsetScreen if you need to do colour sensitive work.\n- Choose from a range of presets, and reset to default if things go wonky.\n- Small, fast, elegant and easy to use interface in less than a megabyte.\n- Isn't patent pending unlike something beginning with 'F' ;)\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/sunset-screen/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-22T01:33:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sunset-screen/1.50", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/sunset-screen/1.50", "licenseUrl": "https://www.skytopia.com/software/sunsetscreen/sunsetscreen-license.html", "packageName": "sunset-screen", "displayName": "Sunset Screen", "summary": "SunsetScreen allows you to warm the colours of the screen to avoid blue glare and sleep better at night.
