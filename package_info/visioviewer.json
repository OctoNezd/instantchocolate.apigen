{"description": "By using Microsoft Visio Viewer, Visio users can freely distribute Visio drawings (files with a .vsdx, .vsdm, .vsd, .vdx, .vdw, .vstx, .vstm, .vst, or .vtx extension) to team members, partners, customers, or others, even if the recipients do not have Visio installed on their computers. Internet Explorer also allows for printing, although this is limited to the portion of the drawing displayed.\n\nViewing Visio drawings is as simple as double-clicking the drawing file in Windows Explorer. Internet Explorer will open, and Visio Viewer will render the drawing in the browser window. You can then pan and zoom in the drawing window by using toolbar buttons, keyboard shortcuts, or menu items in the shortcut menu. Also, you can see properties on any shape by opening the Properties dialog box and then selecting a shape. Some rendering and display settings are available in the Display tab of the Properties dialog box. Additionally, you can set drawing-layer visibility and colors in the Layers tab, and comment visibility and colors in the Comments tab.\n\nNotes\n\n * Visio Viewer is implemented as an ActiveX control that loads and renders Visio drawings inside Internet Explorer.", "updated": "2024-03-23T18:48:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/visioviewer/16.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/visioviewer/16.0", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "visioviewer", "displayName": "Microsoft Visio Viewer", "summary": "Microsoft Visio Viewer allows anyone to view Visio drawings inside their Microsoft Internet Explorer Web browser.", "version": "16.0", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnthonyMastrean/chocolateypackages/a258cef641bdcbd18c2bf6512cc73b4aecb67565/public/icons/microsoftoffice.png", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 82327, "tags": ["microsoft", "visio", "viewer"]}
