{"description": "`sd` is an intuitive find and replace CLI.\n\n## Features\n\n* Painless regular expressions - `sd` uses regex syntax that you already know from JavaScript and Python. Forget about dealing with quirks of `sed` or `awk` - get productive immediately.\n* String-literal mode - Non-regex find & replace. No more backslashes or remembering which characters are special and need to be escaped.\n* Easy to read, easy to write - Find & replace expressions are split up, which makes them easy to read and write. No more messing with unclosed and escaped slashes.\n* Smart, common-sense defaults - Defaults follow common sense and are tailored for typical daily use.\n\n## Notes\n\n* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).\n  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:33:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sd-cli/0.7.5", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/sd-cli/0.7.5", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/chmln/sd/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "sd-cli", "displayName": "sd - s[earch] & d[isplace]", "summary": "Intuitive find and replace CLI", "version": "0.7.5", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@870b9adb7bb9949508f14b26a492cbc5c0fa6759/icons/sd-cli.png", "author": "chmln", "downloadCount": 11299, "tags": ["search-displace", "text-processing", "regex", "search", "find", "replace", "command-line", "cli", "chmln"]}
