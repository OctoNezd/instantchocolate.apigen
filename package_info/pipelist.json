{"description": "Displays the named pipes on your system, including the number of maximum instances and active instances for each pipe.\n\nThe device driver that implements named pipes is actually a file system driver? In fact, the driver's name is NPFS.SYS,\nfor \"Named Pipe File System\". What you might also find surprising is that its possible to obtain a directory listing of\nthe named pipes defined on a system. This fact is not documented, nor is it possible to do this using the Win32 API.\nDirectly using NtQueryDirectoryFile, the native function that the Win32 FindFile APIs rely on, makes it possible to\nlist the pipes. The directory listing NPFS returns also indicates the maximum number of pipe\ninstances set for each pipe and the number of active instances.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@ab7733d9bd5714cac138fe9e5eec447633fb3d75/automatic/pipelist/screenshot.png)\n\n## Notes\n\n* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).\n  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-21T22:03:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pipelist/1.02", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pipelist/1.02", "licenseUrl": "https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/license-terms", "packageName": "pipelist", "displayName": "PipeList - Windows Sysinternals", "summary": "Displays the named pipes on a system, including the number of maximum instances and active instances for each pipe", "version": "1.02", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@024a0e31a291ceea63f7af5e63e2679403c5aa8f/icons/sysinternals.png", "author": "Mark Russinovich", "downloadCount": 1420, "tags": ["pipe", "npfs", "named-pipe", "tools", "sysinternals"]}
