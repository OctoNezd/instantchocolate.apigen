{"description": "Highest-quality GIF encoder based on [pngquant](https://pngquant.org).\n\n**[gifski](https://gif.ski)** converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant's fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.\n\n## Usage\n\ngifski is a command-line tool. There is no GUI for Windows or Linux (there is one for [macOS](https://sindresorhus.com/gifski)).\n\nThe recommended way is to first export video as PNG frames. If you have `ffmpeg` installed, you can run in terminal:\n\n```sh\nffmpeg -i video.webm frame%04d.png\n```\n\nand then make the GIF from the frames:\n\n```sh\ngifski -o anim.gif frame*.png\n```\n\nYou can also resize frames (with `-W <width in pixels>` option). If the input was ever encoded using a lossy video codec it's recommended to at least halve size of the frames to hide compression artefacts and counter chroma subsampling that was done by the video codec.\n\nAdding `--quality=90` may reduce file sizes a bit, but expect to lose a lot of quality for little gain. GIF just isn't that good at compressing, no matter how much you compromise.\n\nSee `gifski -h` for more options.", "updated": "2024-03-23T06:03:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gifski/1.13.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/gifski/1.13.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/ImageOptim/gifski/blob/main/LICENSE", "packageName": "gifski", "displayName": "gifski", "summary": "GIF encoder based on libimagequant (pngquant).
