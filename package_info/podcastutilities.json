{"description": "There are many sophisticated media management programs available for organising digital media however the key differences that Podcast Utilities has are\n\n*Portable* Podcast Utilities is a \u201cportable\u201d application, in that it does not need to be installed and can be run from any drive type, local network or removable flash drive\n\n*Configurable* Almost any synchronisation solution can be configured, for example copy 3 of this podcast, all of these podcasts, in this order, and leave a certain amount of space on the device. The number of concurrent downloads can easily be configured.\n\n*Lightweight* The application does not use large amounts of memory in a system tray icon all the time its not being used, it only uses system resources when its being run.\n\n*Support for UMS and MTP* PodcastUtilities supports USB Mass Storage (UMS) devices, where the device appears as a drive letter in Explorer like a flash drive, as well as MTP devices where the device appears as a portable device, for example many phones.\n\n*Scriptable* Podcast Utilities lends itself to being run as a scheduled task or from a script. The API is \u201cheadless\u201d and can easily be called and used from other applications\n\n*Open Source* The source is open and available\n\n*Free* There is no cost to using Podcast Utilities for any use.\n\n*No need for an iTunes account* Podcasts promoted on iTunes can be downloaded however there is no need to have an iTunes account.\n\nThis version runs on Windows only as it needs the .NET Framework, if you want a cross platform (Windows,Linux,Mac) version then try the [podcastutilities-core package](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/podcastutilities-core). You probably dont need to install both.", "updated": "2024-03-18T08:18:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/podcastutilities/3.1.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/podcastutilities/3.1.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/derekwilson/PodcastUtilities/blob/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "podcastutilities", "displayName": "PodcastUtilities Install", "summary": "PodcastUtilities are a set of utilities designed to help manage digital media on removable drives.
