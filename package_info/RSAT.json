{"description": "Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) enables IT administrators to remotely manage roles and features in versions of Windows Server since 2008 R2 from a computer that is running Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista.\n\n### Notes\n* RSAT will install *only* on Business, Ultimate, Professional, Education, or Enterprise (or LTSB/LTSC) editions of Windows.  You cannot install RSAT on computers that are running Home or Standard editions of Windows. \n* Windows Vista and Windows 7 are no longer supported, the RSAT downloads are unavailable, and this package will fail for those operating system versions. \n* This package will install the latest version of RSAT for the running Windows OS **unless** it is Windows 10 **AND** the `Server` package parameter is used as follows:\n\n    `choco install rsat -params '\"/Server:2016\"'`\n\n##### Windows 10 (pre-1809) RSAT version recommendations:\n* use the latest (default) when managing Windows Server, version 1803 or 1709 (Both `1803` and `1709` are available if needed.)\n* use `2016` when managing Windows Server 2016 or previous versions\n\n### Windows 10 release 1809+\nWith the September 2018 release of Windows, RSAT is no longer a single install nor is it associated with a specific server version.  Each of the RSAT features are separately available through Features on Demand.  This package should allow for download and installation of some or all of the RSAT features.  The `/server` parameter (above) is ignored here, and all the (20+) available RSAT features will be installed unless you choose one or more of the most common features using the following parameters:\n\n* `/AD` - Install the Active Directory Management feature.\n* `/GP` - Install the Group Policy Management feature.\n* `/SM` - Install the Server Manager feature.\n* `/CS` - Install the Certificate Services feature.\n* `/RD` - Install the Remote Desktop Management feature.\n* `/FS` - Install the File Services Management feature.\n* `/DNS` - Install the Domain Name Services Management feature.\n* `/DHCP` - Install the DHCP Management feature.\n* `/WSUS` - Install the WSUS Management feature.\n* `/BL` - Install the BitLocker Drive Encryption Administration Utilities feature.\n      \n*Example:* `choco install rsat -params '\"/AD /GP /DHCP\"'`", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:33:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/RSAT/2.1809.0.20210815", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/RSAT/2.1809.0.20210815", "licenseUrl": "https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/mats_eula", "packageName": "RSAT", "displayName": "Remote Server Administration Tools", "summary": "Remotely manage roles and features in Windows Server.", "version": "2.1809.0.20210815", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages/master/Icons/rsat_icon.png", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 224572, "tags": ["rsat", "Windows", "adminpak", "server", "features"]}
