{"description": "Dropboxifier helps you share saved games and application data between computers by simplifying the process of adding folders to Dropbox and creating symbolic links. If you've ever used Chrome/Firefox Sync, or played a game that had Steam Cloud support, then you've already experienced what Dropboxifier can do for you!\n\nDropboxifier was originally made to work with Dropbox but will also work with any other online storage application that creates a virtual folder on your hard drive (SkyDrive, Google Drive, etc).\n\nSo how does it work? Well, Dropboxifier simply fools applications into reading and writing directly from Dropbox! Saved games and profile data can be placed in Dropbox, a symbolic link put in its place (which is kind of like a shortcut at the file system level), and applications/games won't even notice - they will read and write directly to your Dropbox folder.\n\n#### Documentation\n* [Manual](http://dropboxifier.codeplex.com/documentation)\n\n#### Community\n* [Forum](http://dropboxifier.codeplex.com/discussions)", "updated": "2024-03-22T14:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dropboxifier/0.1.8", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/dropboxifier/0.1.8", "licenseUrl": "http://dropboxifier.codeplex.com/license", "packageName": "dropboxifier", "displayName": "Dropboxifier", "summary": "Backup and share saved data", "version": "0.1.8", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/08e7845c95a3939bed6c61e17047ab4a8c4401cd/icons/dropboxifier.png", "author": "David Gagnon", "downloadCount": 1253, "tags": ["synchronization", "cloud", "backup", "symlink", "junction"]}
