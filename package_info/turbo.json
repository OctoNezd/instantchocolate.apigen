{"description": "Turbo allows you to package applications and their dependencies into a lightweight, isolated virtual environment called a \"container.\" Containerized applications can then be run on any Windows machine that has Turbo installed, no matter the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates installs, conflicts, breaks, and missing dependencies.\nTurbo containers are built on top of the Spoon Virtual Machine, an application virtualization engine that provides lightweight namespace isolation of core operating system objects such as the filesystem, registry, process, networking, and threading subsystems.", "updated": "2024-03-23T10:48:52Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/turbo/1.0.0.20151117", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/turbo/1.0.0.20151117", "licenseUrl": "https://turbo.net/terms/terms", "packageName": "turbo", "displayName": "Turbo", "summary": "Dramatically simplify and make more reliable all phases of the software creation and deployment lifecycle.", "version": "1.0.0.20151117", "icon": "https://turbo.net/io/users/turbo/upload/Turbo.png", "author": "Turbo.net", "downloadCount": 1670, "tags": ["turbo", "containers", "software", "virtualization"]}
