{"description": "Tweakeze (Tweak Easy) is designed to monitor your machine in real-time and execute pre-defined or custom scripting actions when these events happen. It also includes several junk cleaning options to round its feature set out. You can create custom watchers specifying the triggers, like when an executable starts/stops. It permits you to organize them into neat categories or by name with the corresponding action to be carried out.\n\nThese actions can trigger regular file/folder and Registry operations (i.e., delete, move, copy, set) or run a script to capture changes and filter their execution or execute a completely different task. All Active Script Languages installed on your machine (i.e., VBScript, Jscript, PHP, etc.) and PowerShell scripting is currently supported.", "updated": "2024-03-23T10:33:43Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/tweakeze.portable/2.08.1222", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/tweakeze.portable/2.08.1222", "licenseUrl": "https://tweakeze.com/license.php", "packageName": "tweakeze.portable", "displayName": "Tweakeze Portable", "summary": "Tweakeze is a well-rounded monitoring tool providing you with many useful options for keeping a handle on what goes on with your machine in real-time", "version": "2.08.1222", "icon": "https://ik.imagekit.io/tweakeze/tweakeze.png", "author": "Tweakeze Software Inc", "downloadCount": 481, "tags": ["software", "freeware", "program", "real-time", "system", "monitoring", "watch", "folder", "file", "cleaning", "cleaner", "organizing", "tweaking", "tweaks", "organizer", "windows", "computer"]}
