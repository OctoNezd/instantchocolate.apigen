This package will start the spooler and configure it to auto-start.\n\n### Install Options\nBy default, this package will *not* install the Fax printer and will *not* add a desktop icon, but you can change that through package parameters:\n\n* `/Icon` - Installs the desktop icon.\n* `/Fax` - Installs the fax printer.\n* `/Basic` - Only the PDF24 virtual printer is enabled to start.  All \"extra\" features (shell context menu item, screen capture, mail, cloud print, tray icon) are disabled by default.
