{"description": "Soupault is a static website generator and an HTML processor.\n\tClassic website generators that treat HTML as an opaque format that can only be generated with templates.\n\tSoupault is more like a robotic webmaster that can automatically edit HTML.\n\tLike web browsers, it can parse HTML and manipulate its element tree,\n\tbut it can also save it to a static page afterwards.\n\t\n\tBuilt-in functionality includes ToC, footnotes, setting the page title and more.\n\tYou can also run element content through external programs, e.g. pipe the content of <pre> tags\n\tthrough a syntax highlighting program.\n\tIt can also extract metadata from pages using CSS selectors and render it using\n\ta built-in template processor or an external script.\n\t\n\tYou can extend soupault with Lua plugins that offer an API similar to the DOM API of browsers.", "updated": "2024-03-05T18:33:34Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/soupault/2.5.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/soupault/2.5.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/dmbaturin/soupault/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "soupault", "displayName": "soupault", "summary": "Static website generator based on HTML rewriting", "version": "2.5.0", "icon": "https://soupault.app/images/soupault_icon.png", "author": "Daniil Baturin and contributors", "downloadCount": 228, "tags": ["soupault"]}
