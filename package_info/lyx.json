{"description": "LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based on the structure of your documents ([WYSIWYM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM)) and not simply their appearance ([WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG)).\n\nLyX combines the power and flexibility of [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)/[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) with the ease of use of a graphical interface. This results in world-class support for creation of mathematical content (via a fully integrated equation editor) and structured documents like academic articles, theses, and books. In addition, staples of scientific authoring such as reference list and index creation come standard. But you can also use LyX to create a letter or a novel or a theatre play or film script. A broad array of ready, well-designed document layouts are built in.\n\nLyX is for people who want their writing to look great, right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting details, \u201cfinger painting\u201d font attributes or futzing around with page boundaries. You just write. On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output \u2014 or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced \u2014 looks like nothing else.\n\nLyX is released under a [Free Software/Open Source license](https://www.lyx.org/License), runs on Linux/Unix, Windows, and Mac OS X, and is available in [several languages](https://www.lyx.org/I18n).\n\n## Features\nSee. https://www.lyx.org/Features for more details\n- Math/science features\n- Structured document creation\n- Graphics/tables\n- Internationalization\n- Document formats\n- Usability/user interface\n- Document management\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/lyx/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-23T18:18:37Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/lyx/2.3.7.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/lyx/2.3.7.1", "licenseUrl": "https://www.lyx.org/License", "packageName": "lyx", "displayName": "LyX", "summary": "Document processor that encourages an approach to writing based on the structure of your documents (WYSIWYM) and not simply their appearance (WYSIWYG).", "version": "2.3.7.1", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/lyx/lyx.png", "author": "LyX Team", "downloadCount": 35511, "tags": ["lyx", "tex", "latex", "document", "publishing"]}
