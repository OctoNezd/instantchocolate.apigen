{"description": "Termite is an easy to use and easy to configure RS232 terminal. It uses an interface similar to that of \"messenger\" or \"chat\" programs, with a large window that contains all received data and an edit line for typing in strings to transmit. Highlights of the utility are the ease of installation (possibly with pre-configured settings) using a heuristic search for the appropriate COM port and, as was mentioned, its user-friendliness.\n\nOther features are:\n  * [Plug-in interface](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm#FILTERS) for pre-processing or alternative views of the data, logging received data to a file, adding a toolbar to Termite, keyboard macros, and other functionality that you may think of.\n  * A [history of commands](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm#EDITHISTORY) that you typed, with auto-completion.\n  * Resizeable main window, with a \"keep window on top\" option, multilingual user interface.\n  * Ability to run with [pre-configured settings](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm#CONFIGURATION) from a read-only medium (no installation is necessary).\n  * Support for [non-standard Baud rates](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm#NONSTANDARD_BAUD) (MIDI, DMX512).\n  * Different colouring for transmitted and received data (blue=transmitted, green=received).\n  * Data can be [forwarded between two RS232 ports](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm#FORWARDDATA).\n  * Search dialog for transmitted/received text (right-click pop-up menu).\n  * [Save or print](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm#POPUPMENU) the contents of the transmitted/received text (right-click pop-up menu).", "updated": "2024-03-22T14:33:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/termite/3.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/termite/3.4", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "termite", "displayName": "Termite", "summary": "Termite is an easy to use and easy to configure RS232 terminal.", "version": "3.4", "icon": "", "author": "Thiadmer Riemersma,  CompuPhase", "downloadCount": 3883, "tags": ["termite", "RS232", "COM", "terminal", "serial"]}
