{"description": "If you use TeamCity continuous integration server to build and test your Visual Studio projects, TeamCity Add-in can help you access, execute, and analyze builds and tests on your TeamCity server without leaving Visual Studio.\n\nYou can get the most from TeamCity Add-in when working with centralized version control systems (VCS) (like Perforce, Subversion, or Team Foundation Server), where light feature branches are not a part of the workflow. For these VCSs, TeamCity Add-in provides the possibility to run personal builds so that you can test your local changes on your TeamCity server before you commit them to your VCS.\n\nThe TeamCity Add-in is a free Visual Studio extension that seamlessly integrates with Visual Studio 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2017 and with other JetBrains .NET tools such as ReSharper and dotCover.\n\n#### Package Parameters\n\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n * `/PerMachine` - install machine-wide (instead of per-user)", "updated": "2024-03-23T11:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/TeamCityAddin/2023.3.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/TeamCityAddin/2023.3.4", "licenseUrl": "https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/buy/", "packageName": "TeamCityAddin", "displayName": "JetBrains TeamCity Add-in", "summary": "TeamCity integration provider in Visual Studio", "version": "2023.3.4", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetBrains/Chocolatey/master/TeamCityAddin/logo.png", "author": "JetBrains", "downloadCount": 55370, "tags": ["jetbrains", "developer", "admin", "visualstudio", "teamcity"]}
