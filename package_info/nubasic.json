Large sections of the basic constructs of nuBASIC are compatible with other BASIC dialects.\n\nnuBASIC is also very simple. It is an excellent tool for teaching programming to a complete beginner, despite this, it has all the features of a modern programming language.\n\nIt allows you to write both classic BASIC programs (which use line numbers and GoTo or GoSub control structures) and procedure oriented programs, based on procedural programming paradigm.\n\nFeatures\n* Free and Open Source (distributed under GPLv2 License)\n* Easy to use and simple enough for 8-year-old-child to understand\n* Fully-developed procedural programming language\n* Multiplatform. Runs on 32-bit and 64-bit Linux/Windows x86/amd64\n* Built-in help\n* Documented (English and Italian Guides)\n* IDE for Windows\n* Examples include Tetris, Mine Hunter, Breakout, Calculator, TicTacToe\n* Tiny version is suitable for embedded systems\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/nubasic/readme.md)**\n\t\n\n___\n\nClick here to [Patreon-ize](https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3) the package maintainer.\n___", "updated": "2024-03-20T16:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/nubasic/1.51.0.20211023", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/nubasic/1.51.0.20211023", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/eantcal/nubasic/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "nubasic", "displayName": "nuBASIC (Install)", "summary": "BASIC language interpreter for Linux and Windows", "version": "1.51.0.20211023", "icon": "https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/nubasic/nubasic_icon.png", "author": "Antonino Calderone", "downloadCount": 2331, "tags": ["acalderone", "nubasic", "basic", "interpreter", "programming", "language", "ide", "notsilent"]}
