{"description": "---\n\n### [choco://choco-continuous-upgrader](choco://choco-continuous-upgrader)\nTo use choco:// protocol URLs, install [(unofficial) choco:// Protocol support ](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-protocol-support)\n\n---\n\n![Screenshot of choco-continuous-upgrader](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/choco-continuous-upgrader/choco-continuous-upgrader_screenshot.png)\n[Click here for secret GeekMode screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/choco-continuous-upgrader/choco-continuous-upgrader_geekmodescreenshot.png)\n\nThis package is a pseudo replacement for [choco-upgrade-all-at](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at) which is a pseudo replacement for [choco-upgrade-all-at-startup](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at-startup). (Got that? There will be a pop quiz!) **CCU** is a result of my obsessive desire to keep my Chocolatey packages up-to-date.\n\n# DO YOU WANT TO UPGRADE YOUR CHOCOLATEY PACKAGES CONTINUOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY?\n\n# YOU JUST FOUND THE EASIEST WAY!\n\t\n# HOW DOES IT WORK?\n\n**CCU** starts a background PowerShell process which continuously checks [FeedBurner](https://feeds.feedburner.com/chocolatey) for recently published Chocolatey packages. When locally installed packages are found in the feed, they are automatically upgraded.\n\n**CCU** defaults to checking every 30 minutes, automatically upgrading packages, and no foreground notifications. These defaults are overridable and configurable; e.g. you could use **CCU** to just notify you of upgrades every hour without automatically installing them.\n\n### HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:\nInstall my [choco-toast-notifications.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-toast-notifications.hook) to enable beautiful foreground toast notifications of package installs, upgrades, and uninstalls. If you plan to use **CCU** only for notifications of upgrades without having them automatically installed, I recommend using [burnttoast-psmodule](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/burnttoast-psmodule) for those notifications.\n\n### USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n**CCU -Start** will start **CCU** with defaults or your preferences if you created a config file.\n**CCU -Stop** to stop **CCU**.\n**CCU -Status** will display **CCU**'s running options and packages that have been upgraded or waiting to be upgraded since last check.\n**CCU -Notify** (assumes -Start) will send foreground notifications of upgrades using either BurntToast or MSG.\n**CCU -NoUpgrades** (assumes -Start) will check for upgrades but not automatically install them.\n**CCU -UpgradeAll** (assumes -Start) runs 'choco upgrade all -y' before continuously checking for upgrades.\n**CCU -CreateConfig** to set your preferences.\n**CCU -CreateTask** to set CCU to run on bootup.\n**CCU -Help** for more info.\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/choco-continuous-upgrader/readme.md)**\n\n**If you find choco-continuous-upgrader (CCU) useful, and I suspect you will, please consider donating: https://www.paypal.me/bcurran3donations or become a patron at https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3**", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-continuous-upgrader/1.0.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/choco-continuous-upgrader/1.0.2", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html", "packageName": "choco-continuous-upgrader", "displayName": "(unofficial) Chocolatey Continuous Upgrader (CCU) (Script)", "summary": "choco-continuous-upgrader (CCU) - Upgrades your Chocolatey packages continuously throughout the day.", "version": "1.0.2", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/choco-continuous-upgrader/choco-continuous-upgrader_icon.png", "author": "bcurran3", "downloadCount": 504, "tags": ["bcurran3", "unofficial", "CCU", "choco", "upgrade", "all", "cup"]}
