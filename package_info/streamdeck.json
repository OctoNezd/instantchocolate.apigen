{"description": "Stream Deck is the companion application to the Elgato Stream Deck hardware allowing you to customise buttons.\n\nGone are the days of navigating myriad windows to trigger an action, and relying solely on automated plugins to expand your production value. Now, you hold the power to pioneer a new era of content creation, and lead your audience to uncharted frontiers of inspiration. Now, you\u2019re in control.\n\nNOTE: This application states that ONLY supports Windows 10 x64 and later. However, it's been reported that it works on Windows Server 2019. If you use it on anything than Windows 10 x64 you won't be supported  by Elgato and your mileage may vary.\n\n**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:48:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/streamdeck/6.5.2.19936", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/streamdeck/6.5.2.19936", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "streamdeck", "displayName": "Stream Deck (Install)", "summary": "Stream Deck is the companion application to the Elgato Stream Deck hardware allowing you to customise buttons.", "version": "6.5.2.19936", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pauby/ChocoPackages@f08050f3/icons/streamdeck.png", "author": "Elgato Systems GmbH", "downloadCount": 43241, "tags": ["streamdeck", "stream", "deck", "admin"]}
