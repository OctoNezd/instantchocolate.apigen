{"description": "This package installs a version of the Zabbix Agent compiled with TLS support and bundled with openssl libs. Zabbix LLC has refrained from distributing openssl/gnutls/mbedTLS binaries for legal reasons. These sources are extracted from user-contributed builds in support ticket [ZBXNEXT-3047](https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBXNEXT-3047).\n\nExecutables are placed in `%ProgramFiles%\\Zabbix Agent` and the zabbix_agentd.conf file is stored in `%ProgramData%\\zabbix`. When new versions of the agent are installed, the config is not overwritten but rather the version number of the new file is appended to the name. For example, if version 3.2.0 is installed and then upgraded to version 3.4.6 you will find the sample 3.4.6 config files saved as \u201czabbix_agentd-3.4.6.conf\u201d.\n\nThe source code for this Chocolatey package can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/matoro/zabbix-agent-tls-chocolatey), forked from the [original repo maintained by Zabbix LLC](https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix-agent-chocolatey). Please do not file issues to the upstream [tracker](https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix-agent-chocolatey/issues) without verifying they are not unique to this TLS-enabled version.", "updated": "2024-03-19T06:18:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/zabbix-agent-tls/3.4.11", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/zabbix-agent-tls/3.4.11", "licenseUrl": "https://www.zabbix.com/license", "packageName": "zabbix-agent-tls", "displayName": "Zabbix Agent (TLS)", "summary": "The Zabbix agent is used in conjunction with a Zabbix Server to for monitoring a system.", "version": "3.4.11", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zabbix/zabbix-agent-chocolatey/master/logo/zabbix_logo_500x131.png", "author": "Zabbix SIA", "downloadCount": 17165, "tags": ["zabbix", "monitoring", "admin"]}
