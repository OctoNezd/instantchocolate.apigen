{"description": "Monaco is a tool for deploying monitoring configuration to one or multiple Dynatrace Environments. Monaco can aslo update existing configurations in environments.\n\nThe key features of Monaco are:\n\n* **Monitoring as Code**: Monitoring configuration is described using a high-level configuration syntax (JSON and YAML). This allows for configurations to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, configuration can be shared and re-used.\n* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your configurations with minimal human interaction. This avoids many possible human errors.\n\nFor more information, see the [introduction section](https://dynatrace-oss.github.io/dynatrace-monitoring-as-code/).", "updated": "2024-03-14T11:18:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/monaco/1.8.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/monaco/1.8.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-monitoring-as-code/blob/main/LICENSE", "packageName": "monaco", "displayName": "monaco", "summary": "monaco is a tool for automating the deployment process of Dynatrace Monitoring Configuration to one or multiple Dynatrace environments.", "version": "1.8.1", "icon": "", "author": "Dynatrace Open Source", "downloadCount": 263, "tags": ["monaco"]}
