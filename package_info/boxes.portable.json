{"description": "*Boxes* is a command line program that draws a box around its input text. It can remove\nand repair those boxes, too. You can easily make your own box designs if you wish, but many designs are\nalready provided. *Boxes* integrates well with text editors and IDEs as a general text filter.\n\n*Boxes* is a portable application (hence the `.portable` suffix in the choco package ID). It is installed into\nthe package directory `%ChocolateyInstall%\\lib\\boxes.portable`. Chocolatey makes *boxes* available to you on the `PATH`\nvia its `%ChocolateyInstall%\\bin` directory. This is the only official *boxes* choco package.\n\n### Examples\n\nAfter *boxes* is installed, try calling it like this:\n\n`C:\\>echo Hello World | boxes`\n```\n/***************/\n/* Hello World */\n/***************/\n```\n\nor like this:\n\n`C:\\>echo Hello World! | boxes -d unicornsay`\n```\n _______________\n/               \\\n| Hello World!  |\n\\_________  __'\\\n          |/   \\\\\n           \\    \\\\  .\n                |\\\\/|\n                / \" '\\\n                . .   .\n               /    ) |\n              '  _.'  |\n              '-'/    \\\n```\n\n### Modifying boxes.cfg\n\nAt some point, you may wish to modify existing box designs or even add your own.\nIn that case, we recommend that you don't change the central boxes.cfg in `%ChocolateyInstall%\\lib\\boxes.portable\\tools`\ndirectly, because that one may get updated in subsequent releases. Instead, create a new boxes.cfg in your `%HOME%`\ndirectory, and place a line in it saying\n\n```\nparent :global:\n```\n\nThis will make it inherit the global config. You can add any new or modified designs in your new personal config.\n\nDetails on where boxes looks for configuration files can be found\n[here](https://boxes.thomasjensen.com/v2.2.1/boxes-man-1.html#CONFIGURATION%20FILE).\n\n&nbsp;", "updated": "2024-03-20T00:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/boxes.portable/2.3.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/boxes.portable/2.3.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ascii-boxes/boxes/v2.3.0/LICENSE", "packageName": "boxes.portable", "displayName": "boxes (Portable)", "summary": "Command Line ASCII Boxes Unlimited!", "version": "2.3.0", "icon": "https://boxes.thomasjensen.com/images/boxes-sq-256.png", "author": "Thomas Jensen and the boxes contributors", "downloadCount": 1241, "tags": ["ascii", "ascii-art", "box", "boxes", "command-line", "cli"]}
