{"description": "NEW FEATURES: chapter support + blackdetect scene detection\n\nThe simplest + sexiest tool for cutting and joining your videos without needing to re-encode with a powerful OpenGL based, hardware-accelerated video rendering.\n\nVidCutter focuses on just getting the job done using the best options determined from your source media. Did we mention it was super fast too?\n\nmpv powered playback for frame-level accuracy and support for the widest array of media file formats and codec/filter configurations, it should work with any source media you throw at it as long as its valid. It should even accept moderately corrupted media too, re-indexing and salvaging what it can if the metadata exists. Direct-stream cutting and joining is then performed with the help of the legendary FFmpeg library. No reencoding ever, even blue-ray sized files cut into scenes, rearranged in the index and joined together in under 10 seconds in most cases.\n\ninstall location: %PROGRAMFILES%\\VidCutter", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:33:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vidcutter/6.0.5.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vidcutter/6.0.5.1", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html", "packageName": "vidcutter", "displayName": "VidCutter", "summary": "the simplest + fastest media cutter and joiner", "version": "6.0.5.1", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/ozmartian/vidcutter/6c803f35/data/icons/vidcutter.png", "author": "Pete Alexandrou", "downloadCount": 7859, "tags": ["vidcutter", "ffmpeg", "audiovideo", "opengl", "mpv", "libmpv", "videoeditor", "video", "videoedit", "pyqt", "Qt5", "multimedia", "admin"]}
