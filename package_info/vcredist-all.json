{"description": "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installs run-time components of Visual C++ libraries. These components are required to run C++ applications that are developed using Visual Studio and link dynamically to Visual C++ libraries. The packages can be used to run such applications on a computer even if it does not have Visual Studio installed. These packages also install run-time components of C Runtime (CRT), Standard C++, MFC, C++ AMP, and OpenMP libraries.\n\nThis metapackage installs packages for all Visual C++ Runtime releases since 2005.\n\n(Yes, dependencies on vcredist2015 and vcredist2017 are redundant, but are included here because other packages depend on them.)", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vcredist-all/1.0.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vcredist-all/1.0.1", "licenseUrl": "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement", "packageName": "vcredist-all", "displayName": "Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime - all versions", "summary": "Run-time components that are required to run C++ applications that are built by using Visual Studio", "version": "1.0.1", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/jberezanski/ChocolateyPackages/17d25f2fb8a31d40b93a696e345c22a77913418f/icons/vs2017.png", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 559986, "tags": ["microsoft", "visual", "c++", "runtime", "redistributable", "vcredist", "vcruntime", "admin"]}
