{"description": "Compute and save MD5, SHA1, SHA2, RIPEMD hashes and CRC16/32 checksums for multiple files! Calculate hashes and checksums for the whole file or just specified bytes. Insert hashes into files in text or binary form. Generate file list with hashes in specified format and save it to a file. Rename files and include hashes in file name.\nProcess 1000s of files using multiple CPU cores in manual, automatic/continuous, triggered/scheduled, or console modes, or directly from Windows Explorer right-click menu. Save files to output directory specified using either absolute or relative path, with original or new name defined by a mask. Select files for processing based on their name, dates, size, and contents using advanced file search supporting RegEx and advanced wildcards. Optionally merge together, split all, or zip processed files. Perform different operations on different files with conditional processing and process branching. Detailed processing logs are available in both user interface and log files. Run multiple program instances simultaneously.\n\n    Note: This is a fully functional trial version. Processed files are limited in size.", "updated": "2024-03-18T01:18:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/file-hash-generator/5.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/file-hash-generator/5.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.binarymark.com/eula.aspx", "packageName": "file-hash-generator", "displayName": "File Hash Generator", "summary": "Calculate and save file hashes and checksums", "version": "5.0.0", "icon": "https://www.binarymark.com/img/box/box22_std.png", "author": "BinaryMark", "downloadCount": 1958, "tags": ["file-hash-generator", "batch", "multiple", "bulk", "mass", "files", "generate", "compute", "hash", "checksum", "md5", "trial", "admin"]}
