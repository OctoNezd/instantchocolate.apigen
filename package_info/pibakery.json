{"description": "The key feature of PiBakery is the ability to create a customised version of Raspbian that you write directly to your Raspberry Pi. This works by creating a set of scripts that run when the Raspberry Pi has been powered on, meaning that your Pi can automatically perform setup tasks, and you don't need to configure anything.", "updated": "2024-03-18T03:34:00Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pibakery/0.3.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pibakery/0.3.4", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.de.html", "packageName": "pibakery", "displayName": "PiBakery", "summary": "The easiest way to setup a Raspberry Pi", "version": "0.3.4", "icon": "http://www.pibakery.org/img/blocks.png", "author": "David Ferguson", "downloadCount": 1994, "tags": ["pibakery", "admin", "raspberry", "pi", "setup"]}
