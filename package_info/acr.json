{"description": "AssaultCube Reloaded is a free and open source first person shooter based on the semi-popular AssaultCube, which was based on the Cube FPS. It is multi-platform and low on system and networking requirements (see below), allowing you to have fun playing even with a low-end computer and/or network connection. \n    \nIt is set in realistic looking environments with fast and fun gameplay. As we created our modification, gameplay improved, but some improvements were made in exchange for higher networking requirements.\n\nNOTE: A shortcut called 'AC Reloaded' is created to allow you to easily run the program.\n\nNOTE: If you get the error 'The program can't start because OpenAL32.dll is missing' when running please see %ProgramData%\\chocolatey\\lib\\acr\\tools\\bin_win32\\readme_OpenAL.txt for the solution. This is an application issue and not a package one.\n\n**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-22T06:48:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/acr/2.18.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/acr/2.18.2", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "acr", "displayName": "AssaultCube Reloaded", "summary": "AssaultCube Reloaded is a free and open source first person shooter based on the semi-popular AssaultCube, which was based on the Cube FPS.", "version": "2.18.2", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pauby/ChocoPackages@b8bb49ca/icons/acr.png", "author": "Victor Zheng", "downloadCount": 3427, "tags": ["game", "shooter-game", "cube", "reload"]}
