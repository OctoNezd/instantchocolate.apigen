{"description": "These are the utilities I install on a fresh Windows dev machine.\n\n      I recommend you set a user environment variable of \"chocolatey_bin_root\" with a value of \"bin\" or \"tools\" etc. This prevents packages like Ruby from installing in the root of C:.\n\n      The easiest way to set chocolatey_bin_root is to execute cinst binroot, then open a new console or restart your current console before installing this package.\n\n      Be patient. This package takes a long time to finish.\n\n      If possible, disable UAC before installing this package so that it can run unattended. Otherwise, you will have to approve each application's install.", "updated": "2024-03-15T09:33:48Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/alanstevens.utils/1.17", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/alanstevens.utils/1.17", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "alanstevens.utils", "displayName": "Alan Stevens' Windows Utilities", "summary": "Utilities for a Windows dev machine.", "version": "1.17", "icon": "http://www.elmoensio.com/sisalmykset/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Robocop-on-a-pink-unicorn-with-rainbow-in-the-background-217x300.jpg", "author": "H.
