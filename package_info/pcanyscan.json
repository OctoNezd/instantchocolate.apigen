It finds the pcAnywhere hosts by sending a specific UDP packet to all hosts in the specified range.\n\nYou can use this scanner for checking if there are pcAnywhere hosts running on your TCP/IP network. Be aware that this utility can only detect pcAnywhere hosts that listens on TCP/IP network.\n\nIt cannot detect pcAnywhere hosts on other networks.", "updated": "2024-03-21T10:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pcanyscan/1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pcanyscan/1.0", "licenseUrl": "http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/pcanyscan.html", "packageName": "pcanyscan", "displayName": "pcAnywhere Hosts Scanner", "summary": "Scan network for pcAnywhere clients", "version": "1.0", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/2697586f564894b3346352497da46f320a02e725/icons/pcanyscan.png", "author": "Nir Sofer", "downloadCount": 979, "tags": ["pcanywhere", "network", "scanner"]}
