{"description": "This is a tool to make builds of Portable Executables (PEs) and PDBs reproducible.\n\nTimestamps and other non-deterministic data are embedded in DLLs, EXEs, and PDBs. If some source is compiled and linked twice without changing any source, the binary and PDB will not be bit-for-bit identical both times. This tool fixes that by modifying DLLs/EXEs in-place and rewriting PDBs.\n\nDon't worry, Ducible won't mess with the functionality of your executable. All changes have no functional effect. It merely transforms one perfectly good executable into another perfectly good, yet reproducible(!), executable.", "updated": "2024-03-19T23:18:42Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ducible/1.2.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ducible/1.2.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/jasonwhite/ducible/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "ducible", "displayName": "ducible", "summary": "A tool to make Windows builds reproducible.", "version": "1.2.2", "icon": "", "author": "Jason White", "downloadCount": 521, "tags": ["cli", "build", "tools"]}
