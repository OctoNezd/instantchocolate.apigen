{"description": "RD Tabs is the original advanced multi-tabbed Windows Remote Desktop client and connection manager. It started back in 2006 with a simple idea: bring the then new idea of tabbed web browsers to remote desktop. From there, a way to remember saved session properties that was superior to a bunch of .rdp files was added (favorites), including the ability to batch edit multiple favorites at a time, making management of stored passwords simple. But why stop there? Features allowing split-screen, multiple Windows, scaled desktop sizes were added. Now in present day more advanced features are coming fast. From an integrated PowerShell scripting engine, to colored tabs for organization, RD Tabs makes a System Administrator\u2019s life so much easier.", "updated": "2024-03-20T10:48:23Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rdtabs/3.0.12", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/rdtabs/3.0.12", "licenseUrl": "https://www.avianwaves.com/portals/0/Downloads/Tools/RDTabs/EULA.rtf", "packageName": "rdtabs", "displayName": "RD Tabs", "summary": "RD Tabs: the original multi-tabbed Remote Desktop client", "version": "3.0.12", "icon": "https://www.avianwaves.com/portals/0/images/avianwaves/tools/rdtabs/applicationlogo.png", "author": "Avian Waves LLC", "downloadCount": 5368, "tags": ["RemoteDesktop", "RDP", "RDTabs", "remoting", "remote", "desktop"]}
