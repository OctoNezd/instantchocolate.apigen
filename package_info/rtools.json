{"description": "Rtools is the toolchain bundle that is used on Windows to build R base and R packages that contain compiled code. You only need Rtools if you want to compile R packages from source that contain C/C++/Fortran. By default, R for Windows installs the precompiled binary packages from CRAN, for which you do not need rtools. This Chocolatey package works with the installation defaults, which consist of the standard toolchains based on gcc (32/64 bit mingw-w64) and build utilities (make, bash, tar, sed, etc).", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rtools/4.4.6104", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/rtools/4.4.6104", "licenseUrl": "https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/", "packageName": "rtools", "displayName": "RTools", "summary": "A collection of tools for building R packages under Windows", "version": "4.4.6104", "icon": "https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.svg", "author": "Previous versions were put together by Prof. Brian Ripley,  Duncan Murdoch and Jeroen Ooms.
