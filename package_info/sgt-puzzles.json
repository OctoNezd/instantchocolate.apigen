{"description": "From Simon Tatham: \"I wrote this collection because I thought there should be more small desktop toys available: little games you can pop up in a window and play for two or three minutes while you take a break from whatever else you were doing. And I was also annoyed that every time I found a good game on (say) Unix, it wasn't available the next time I was sitting at a Windows machine, or vice versa; so I arranged that everything in my personal puzzle collection will happily run on both, and have more recently done a port to Mac OS X as well. When I find (or perhaps invent) further puzzle games that I like, they'll be added to this collection and will immediately be available on both platforms. And if anyone feels like writing any other front ends -- PocketPC, Mac OS pre-10, or whatever it might be -- then all the games in this framework will immediately become available on another platform as well.\n    \n    The actual games in this collection were mostly not my invention; they are re-implementations of existing game concepts within my portable puzzle framework. I do not claim credit, in general, for inventing the rules of any of these puzzles. (I don't even claim authorship of all the code; some of the puzzles have been submitted by other authors.)\"", "updated": "2024-03-23T20:03:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sgt-puzzles/2024.03.02", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/sgt-puzzles/2024.03.02", "licenseUrl": "http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/doc/licence.html#licence", "packageName": "sgt-puzzles", "displayName": "Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection", "summary": "A collection of small computer programs which implement one-player puzzle games", "version": "2024.03.02", "icon": "https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/twiddle-web.png", "author": "Simon Tatham", "downloadCount": 22361, "tags": ["sgt-puzzles", "logic", "puzzle", "games", "admin"]}
