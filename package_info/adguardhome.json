{"description": "AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any client-side software for that.\nIt operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a \"black hole\", thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers. It's based on software we use for our public AdGuard DNS servers - both share a lot of common code.", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:18:48Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/adguardhome/0.107.46", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/adguardhome/0.107.46", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/blob/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "adguardhome", "displayName": "AdGuard Home", "summary": "Free and open source, powerful network-wide ads and trackers blocking DNS server.", "version": "0.107.46", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/niks255/ChocolateyPackages/master/adguardhome/icon.png", "author": "AdGuard Software Limited", "downloadCount": 4096, "tags": ["adguard", "dns", "adblock", "admin"]}
