We need tools, libraries, apps and documentation to help us.\n\n## Features\n\n* Manage cryptographic [keys](https://keys.pub/docs/specs/keys.html), [sigchains](https://keys.pub/docs/specs/sigchain.html)\nand [user identities](https://keys.pub/docs/specs/user.html).\n* [Search for keys](https://keys.pub/docs/restapi/user.html#get-user-search), verify and import them.\n* Securely store passwords and secrets.\n* [Encrypt, decrypt](https://keys.pub/docs/cli/encrypt.html), [sign, verify](https://keys.pub/docs/cli/sign.html)\n(using [Saltpack](https://saltpack.org/)).\n* Create a secure connection ([Wormhole](https://keys.pub/docs/specs/wormhole.html)) between 2 computers\n(using [Noise](https://noiseprotocol.org/)).\n* Most features are available in both the app and on the command line.\n* 100% open source ([github.com/keys-pub](http://github.com/keys-pub)).\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@ea605aa7b94cc03226b076a979a37f9b026ab791/automatic/keys/screenshot.png)\n\n## Notes\n\n* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).\n  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-12T16:33:57Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/keys/0.2.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/keys/0.2.4", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/keys-pub/keys/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "keys", "displayName": "Keys - Cryptographic Key Management", "summary": "Cryptographic key management, signing and encryption, including keys/saltpack and keys/keyring", "version": "0.2.4", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@ea605aa7b94cc03226b076a979a37f9b026ab791/icons/keys.png", "author": "Gabriel Handford", "downloadCount": 2135, "tags": ["key-management", "cyptographic-keys", "sigchains", "identities", "encrypt", "decrypt", "sign", "verify", "secure-connection", "keys"]}
