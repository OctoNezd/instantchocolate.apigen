{"description": "FreeFem++ is a partial differential equation solver. It has its own language. freefem scripts can solve multiphysics non linear systems in 2D and 3D.\n\nProblems involving PDE (2d, 3d) from several branches of physics such as fluid-structure interactions require interpolations of data on several meshes and their manipulation within one program. FreeFem++ includes a fast 2^d-tree-based interpolation algorithm and a language for the manipulation of data on multiple meshes (as a follow up of bamg (now a part of FreeFem++ ).", "updated": "2024-03-21T18:48:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/freefemplusplus/4.13", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/freefemplusplus/4.13", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/FreeFem/FreeFem-sources/blob/master/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "freefemplusplus", "displayName": "FreeFEM++", "summary": "FreeFEM is a partial differential equation solver for non-linear multi-physics systems in 2D and 3D using the finite element method.", "version": "4.13", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/usm-community/chocolatey-packages@master/icons/freefem.png", "author": "FreeFEM", "downloadCount": 999, "tags": ["freefemplusplus", "equation", "solver"]}
