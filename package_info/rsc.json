{"description": "# rsc - A generic RightScale API client\n\n`rsc` provides both a command line tool and a go package for interacting with the RightScale APIs.\nThe currently supported APIs are the RightScale Cloud Management API 1.5 and 1.6 APIs, the\nRightScale Self-Service 1.0 APIs (latest version for this product) and the RightLink10 APIs exposed\nby the RightLink10 agent. The RightScale APIs reference can be found on the\n[RightScale docs](http://docs.rightscale.com/api/) site.\n\n`rsc` can be used in one of two ways:\n\n* as a command line tool\n* as a way to make API requests to RightScale programmatically from Go code\n\n## Command Line Tool\n\nThe command line tool uses subcommands to interact with each API. Use `rsc cm15` to send requests\nto the RightScale Cloud Management API 1.5, `rsc cm16` to send requests to the RightScale Cloud\nManagement API 1.6, `rsc ss` to send requests to the RightScale Self-Service API 1.0 and `rsc rl10`\nto send requests to RightLink10.\n\n**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is\nout of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and\nlet them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-20T21:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rsc/9.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/rsc/9.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/rightscale/rsc/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "rsc", "displayName": "rsc - RightScale API Client", "summary": "Generic RightScale API client Go package and command line tool", "version": "9.0.0", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/douglaswth/chocolatey-packages/master/icons/rsc.png", "author": "Flexera", "downloadCount": 3826, "tags": ["rsc", "flexera", "rightscale", "API", "rest", "cli", "go", "golang"]}
