{"description": "MATLAB Runtime is a collection of shared libraries and code that enables the execution of compiled and packaged MATLAB applications on systems without an installed version of MATLAB.\n\n#### Notes\n* The version of the MATLAB Runtime necessary to run an application is tied to the version of MATLAB used to create the application.\n* Multiple versions of the MATLAB Runtime may simultaneously exist on a target machine. This allows applications compiled with different versions of the MATLAB Runtime to execute side by side on the same machine.\n* The MATLAB Runtime Compiler is large (700MB +).  It will take some time to download and install.", "updated": "2024-03-23T07:03:34Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/mcr-r2015a/8.5.0.20190708", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/mcr-r2015a/8.5.0.20190708", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages/master/manual/mcr-r2015a/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "mcr-r2015a", "displayName": "MATLAB Compiler Runtime R2015a", "summary": "Run compiled MATLAB applications or components without installing MATLAB.", "version": "8.5.0.20190708", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages@f5f5b9f6b5afc7dc7446a22954b865f21bd7d80c/Icons/matlab_icon.png", "author": "The Mathworks,  Inc.", "downloadCount": 1022, "tags": ["MATLAB", "compiler", "runtime", "math", "mathematics", "library"]}
