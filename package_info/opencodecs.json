The Xiph.org DirectShow filters support playing of files encoded with Vorbis, Speex, Theora, and/or FLAC.\n\nThe latest development version is always available through SVN at http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/oggdsf/\n\nWebM support is based on versioned snapshots from WebM Project.  See http://code.google.com/p/webm/downloads/list\n\nNote: Xiph.org changed the install filename after version 0.83.17220.  The installer filename was previously \"oggcodecs\".
