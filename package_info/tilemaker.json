{"description": "Tilemaker creates vector tiles (in Mapbox Vector Tile format) from an .osm.pbf planet extract, as typically downloaded from providers like Geofabrik. It aims to be 'stack-free': you need no database and there is only one executable to install.\n\nVector tiles are used by many in-browser/app renderers, and can also power server-side raster rendering. They enable on-the-fly style changes and greater interactivity, while imposing less of a storage burden. You can output them to individual files, or to a SQLite (.mbtiles) database.\n\nSee an example of a vector tile map produced by tilemaker at [tilemaker.org](https://tilemaker.org).\n\n## Why tilemaker?\n\nYou might use tilemaker if:\n\n* You want to create vector tiles yourself, without a third-party contract\n* You don't want to host/maintain a database\n* You want a flexible system capable of advanced OSM tag processing\n* You want to create ready-to-go tiles for offline use\n\nBut don't use tilemaker if:\n\n* You want someone else to create and host the tiles for you\n* You want the entire planet\n* You want continuous updates with the latest OSM data", "updated": "2024-02-29T23:03:23Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/tilemaker/2.4.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/tilemaker/2.4.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/systemed/tilemaker/blob/master/LICENCE.txt", "packageName": "tilemaker", "displayName": "Tilemaker", "summary": "Make OpenStreetMap vector tiles without the stack", "version": "2.4.0", "icon": "", "author": "Richard Fairhurst,  tilemaker contributors", "downloadCount": 61, "tags": ["tilemaker", "gis", "map"]}
