The framework is intended to introduce people to the\ntechniques and complexities associated with extracting digital artifacts\nfrom volatile memory samples and provide a platform for further work into\nthis exciting area of research.", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:03:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/volatility/2.6.0.20190425", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/volatility/2.6.0.20190425", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/blob/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "volatility", "displayName": "Volatility Framework - Standalone", "summary": "The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools,\nimplemented in Python under the GNU General Public License, for the\nextraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.", "version": "2.6.0.20190425", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sippi90/chocolateyautomaticpackages/master/icons/volatility.png", "author": "The Volatility Foundation", "downloadCount": 72350, "tags": ["ram", "memory", "analysis", "investigation", "forensic"]}
