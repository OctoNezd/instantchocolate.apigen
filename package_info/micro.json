{"description": "Micro is a terminal-based text editor that aims to be easy to use and intuitive, while also taking advantage of the full capabilities of modern terminals. It comes as one single, batteries-included, static binary with no dependencies, and you can download and use it right now. As the name indicates, micro aims to be somewhat of a successor to the nano editor by being easy to install and use in a pinch, but micro also aims to be enjoyable to use full time, whether you work in the terminal because you prefer it, or because you need to.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/micro/2.0.11", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/micro/2.0.11", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "micro", "displayName": "micro", "summary": "A modern and intuitive terminal-based text editor", "version": "2.0.11", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zyedidia/micro/master/assets/micro-logo.svg", "author": "Zachary Yedidia", "downloadCount": 67289, "tags": ["text", "editor", "console", "nano", "micro"]}
