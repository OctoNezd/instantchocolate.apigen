Each Nest Learning Thermostat gets its own icon, while Nest Protects get one icon per home. The icons gently fade and transition to let you know what's going on.\n\nYou get a discrete notification when a thermostat notices an interesting change (such as your heating turning on) or an alert if a Nest Protect detects smoke or carbon monoxide (subject to the Terms of Service, please read those, right?).\n\nRoost Desktop Notifier supports the Nest Learning Thermostat in Heat, Cool and Heat \u2022 Cool modes. Temperatures are shown in Celsius or Fahrenheit, depending on your Nest settings. It will work nicely if you have just one Nest Thermostat, a single Nest Protect or lots of both in one or two homes!\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/roost-desktop-notifier-for-nest/readme.md)**\n\n***\n**Click here to [Patreon-ize](https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3) the package maintainer.**\n***", "updated": "2024-03-11T08:03:22Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/roost-desktop-notifier-for-nest/0.9.8.212", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/roost-desktop-notifier-for-nest/0.9.8.212", "licenseUrl": "http://richardeverett.com/Nest", "packageName": "roost-desktop-notifier-for-nest", "displayName": "Roost Desktop Notifier for Nest (Install)", "summary": "Roost is a free Windows desktop app that keeps you connected to your Nest Learning Thermostat\u2122 and Nest Protect\u2122 devices when you're at your PC.", "version": "0.9.8.212", "icon": "https://richardeverett.com/Content/Nest/works-with-nest.png", "author": "Richard Everett", "downloadCount": 962, "tags": ["roost", "nest", "thermostat", "smarthome", "notsilent"]}
