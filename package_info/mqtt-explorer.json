{"description": "# Features\n\n- Visualize topics and topic activity\n- Delete retained topics\n- Search/filter topics\n- Delete topics recursively\n- Diff view of current and previous received messages\n- Publish topics\n- Plot numeric topics\n- Retain a history of each topic\n- Dark/Light Themes\n\n\nThe hierarchical view makes this tool so easy to use and differentiates the MQTT Explorer from other great MQTT clients like MQTTLens, MQTTBox and MQTT.fx.\nThis MQTT Client strives to be a MQTT swiss-army-knife, the perfect tool to integrate new services and IoT devices on your network.\n\n# Performance\nThis MQTT Client is optimized to handle thousands of topics and at hundreds of thousands messages per minute.\n\nCustom subscriptions can limit the amount of messages MQTT Explorer needs to process, subscriptions can be managed in the advanced connection settings.\nIn very large productive environments brokers may handle an extreme load of topics, subscribing with a wildcard topic is in this scenario not advised.\n\n# IoT Applications\nList of useful IoT applications using MQTT to integrate devices / services\n\n- Home Assistant - Open source home automation gateway\n- OpenHAB - Smart Home Gateway\n- Node-RED - Flow-based programming for the Internet of Things\n- zigbee2mqtt - A ZigBee to MQTT bridge\n- Tasmota - ESP8266 firmware with MQTT support\n\n# Telemetry\nNo personal data is processed, sent or stored.\n\nThe app sends telemetry and error reports, this enables me to quickly react on bugs/errors and understand what\u2019s going on. Responding quickly to errors is one key element in producing a reliable software product.\n\nIt basically sends: app version, processor architecture, operating system, used memory, user interactions and error stacks.\n\nEven though the data is purely technical, an option to disable telemetry is planned.
