{"description": "TestDisk is powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily designed to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty software, certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally deleting a Partition Table). Partition table recovery using TestDisk is really easy.\n\nPhotoRec is file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents and archives from hard disks, CD-ROMs, and lost pictures (thus the Photo Recovery name) from digital camera memory. PhotoRec ignores the file system and goes after the underlying data, so it will still work even if your media's file system has been severely damaged or reformatted.\n\n## Features\n- Fix partition table, recover deleted partition\n- Recover FAT32 boot sector from its backup\n- Rebuild FAT12/FAT16/FAT32 boot sector\n- Fix FAT tables\n- Rebuild NTFS boot sector\n- Recover NTFS boot sector from its backup\n- Fix MFT using MFT mirror\n- Locate ext2/ext3/ext4 Backup SuperBlock\n- Undelete files from FAT, exFAT, NTFS and ext2 filesystem\n- Copy files from deleted FAT, exFAT, NTFS and ext2/ext3/ext4 partitions.", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:48:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/testdisk-photorec/7.2.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/testdisk-photorec/7.2.0", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html", "packageName": "testdisk-photorec", "displayName": "TestDisk and PhotoRec", "summary": "Data recovery software", "version": "7.2.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages@edba4a5849ff756e767cba86641bea97ff5721fe/icons/testdisk.svg", "author": "CGSecurity", "downloadCount": 17596, "tags": ["testdisk-photorec", "data", "recovery", "foss", "cross-platform"]}
