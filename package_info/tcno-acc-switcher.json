Most switchers, including Steam work purely off changing a file and a few registry keys. Wastes no time closing, switching and restarting Steam and other platforms.\nNOTE: Not created for cheating purposes. All it does is change accounts. Use it as you see fit, accepting responsibility.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nSimple. It swaps out files and registry values, pointing to your last logged in account while the program is closed. Think of it as freezing a platform like Steam in time, and replacing the \"account block\" with a previously frozen \"account block\", then unfreezing it. To Steam and your Steam account, it \"looks\" like you pulled your plug out and put it back in a week or so later, meanwhile you were playing on other accounts. Swapping the account block lets the program: Not interact with passwords, and not interact with 2-factor, so you can \"Skip\" both of those in the login process.\n\n#### Things not working?
