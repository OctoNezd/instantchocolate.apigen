{"description": "NeoChat is a Matrix client. It allows you to send text messages, videos and audio files to your family, colleagues and friends using the Matrix protocol.\n\nMatrix is a decentralized communication protocol, putting the user back in control. Currently NeoChat implements large part of the protocol with the exception of encrypted chats and video chat.\n\nNeoChat works both on mobile and desktop while providing a consistent user experience.\n\n![Application](https://cdn.kde.org/screenshots/neochat/application.png)\n\n## Features\n\n* Sending messages\n* Sending files from clipboard and filesystem\n* Reply to message (right-click on a message to access menu)\n* Start a private chat (but not encrypted)\n* Show notifications, for the moment there is only a global switch\nto disable it. We plan to implement the configuration part of the\nspecification soon.\n* Autocompletion of usernames in chat\n* Emoji picker\n* Basic room setting page\n* Send and accept invitations\n* /rainbow <message> (very important)\n* /me <message>\n\nNeoChat is still missing a few features to become a full-featured\nMatrix client (most notably encryption support and video chat support).\nWe welcome contributions in this direction.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis program utilizes [libQuotient](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/)\nlibrary and some C++ models from [Quaternion](https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/).\n\nThis program is a fork of [Spectral](https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral/).", "updated": "2024-03-17T15:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/neochat.install/24.1.95", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/neochat.install/24.1.95", "licenseUrl": "https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat/-/blob/v24.01.95/LICENSES/GPL-3.0-or-later.txt", "packageName": "neochat.install", "displayName": "NeoChat (Install)", "summary": "A client for matrix, the decentralized communication protocol", "version": "24.1.95", "icon": "https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat/-/raw/v24.01.95/org.kde.neochat.svg", "author": "KDE Community\nBlack Hat & the Spectral IM Team", "downloadCount": 648, "tags": ["neochat", "matrix", "chat", "communication", "qt"]}
