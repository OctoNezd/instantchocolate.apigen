You feel that you have no control over your own computer. (And it's not how an open Web is supposed to work.)\n* You want to get rid of any closed-source technology or proprietary JavaScript code, and disallow things like Flash running on your computer.\n* You are an adherent of hacker culture and free software.\n\nWhat `you-get` can do for you:\n\n* Download videos / audios from popular websites such as YouTube, Youku, Niconico, and a bunch more. (See the [full list of supported sites](#supported-sites))\n* Stream an online video in your media player. No web browser, no more ads.\n* Download images (of interest) by scraping a web page.\n* Download arbitrary non-HTML contents, i.e., binary files.\n\nInterested?
