{"description": "QRQ is an open source Morse telegraphy trainer which runs on several operating systems (Linux, Unix, OS X and Windows), similar to the classic DOS version of [Rufz](http://www.rufzxp.net) by DL4MM.\n\nIt's not intended for learning telegraphy (check out [LCWO](http://lcwo.net) or have a look at [radio.linux.org.au](http://radio.linux.org.au/?sectpat=morse&ordpat=title) for CW learning software), but to improve the ability to copy callsigns at high speeds, as needed for example for [Contesting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contesting).\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/qrq/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-19T14:49:03Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/qrq/0.3.5", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/qrq/0.3.5", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt", "packageName": "qrq", "displayName": "QRQ - yet another CW trainer", "summary": "QRQ is an open source Morse telegraphy trainer to improve the ability to copy callsigns at high speeds.", "version": "0.3.5", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/qrq/qrq.png", "author": "Fabian Kurz,  DJ1YFK", "downloadCount": 460, "tags": ["qrq", "HAM", "radio", "amateur", "CW", "morse", "trainer", "tutor"]}
