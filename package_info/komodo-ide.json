Now you can quickly toggle print statements as well as easily create them, simply by clicking the editor margin.\n\n**DevDocs.\u200bio Integration**  \nHighlight any word or code snippet and trigger the relevant language docs in DevDocs.\u200bio from inside Komodo, making the process of looking up documentation much simpler.

Bootstrap a new project with the template of your choice, specify settings as needed and start developing right away.\n\n**Dependency Detector**  \nKomodo automatically scans and detects third-party dependencies, giving you immediate insight on what works, and letting you further adjust as needed.
