{"description": "Evoluent Mouse Manager is an optional but powerful software that may be installed to configure the buttons to perform many common functions for VerticalMouse. For example, button 2 may be configured to perform a double click with a single actual click to open a program, button 3 may be configured to open a link in a new tab, button 4 may be configured to cycle through open tabs, button 5 may be configured to close a tab, etc. This reduces the need to frequently move your hand between the mouse and the keyboard, and the need to move the mouse and click different areas of the screen.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/evoluentmousemanager/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-21T19:03:23Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/evoluentmousemanager/6.0.9.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/evoluentmousemanager/6.0.9.2", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "evoluentmousemanager", "displayName": "Evoluent Mouse Manager for VerticalMouse 4 and D", "summary": "Evoluent Mouse Manager is an optional but powerful software that may be installed to configure the buttons to perform many common functions for VerticalMouse.", "version": "6.0.9.2", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/evoluentmousemanager/evoluentmousemanager.png", "author": "Evoluent Team", "downloadCount": 263, "tags": ["evoluentmousemanager", "evoluent", "mouse", "manager", "vertical", "4", "d"]}
