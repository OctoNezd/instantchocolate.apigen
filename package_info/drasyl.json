{"description": "**Note: This package comes without any Java dependency. You have to install a JRE or JDK by yourself.** \n\ndrasyl is a general-purpose overlay network framework for rapid development of distributed P2P\napplications.\n\nBy using drasyl developers can fully concentrate on creating distributed applications. With drasyl,\nboundaries between IP-based networks will be eliminated and secure communication channels between\nany peers will be provided. Zero-configuration is required to use drasyl. Developers can run a new\ndrasyl node without having to write configuration files or provide IP addresses of peers.\n\n![drasyl architecture](https://docs.drasyl.org/master/assets/img/drasyl-architecture.png)\n\n## Features\n\n- Provides Communication Channels between any two Nodes (on the Internet).\n- Automatic Discovery of Peers running within same Process, Computer, LAN, or the Internet.\n- Automatic Handover to most local Communication Channel.\n- Overcomes Network Barriers (Statefull Firewalls, NATs).\n- UDP Hole Punching.\n- Port Mapping (UPnP-IGD, NAT-PMP, PCP).  \n- Reacts to Network Changes.\n- Asynchronous and Event-Driven.\n- Lightweight.\n- Extensible.\n\n## Usage and Documentation\n\n- [Command Line Interface](https://docs.drasyl.org/cli/)\n- [Configuration](https://docs.drasyl.org/configuration/)\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/2tcZPy7BCu)\n\n## License\n\nThis is free software under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE)", "updated": "2024-03-22T00:03:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/drasyl/0.10.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/drasyl/0.10.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drasyl/drasyl/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "drasyl", "displayName": "drasyl", "summary": "general-purpose overlay network framework for rapid development of distributed P2P applications.
