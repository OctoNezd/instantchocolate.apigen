{"description": "TinyCC (aka TCC) is a small but hyper fast C compiler. Unlike other C compilers, it is meant to be self-relying: you do not need an external assembler or linker because TCC does that for you.\n\nTCC not only supports ANSI C, but also most of the new ISO C99 standard and many GNUC extensions including inline assembly.\n\nTCC can also be used to make C scripts, i.e. pieces of C source that you run as a Perl or Python script.\n\nTCC can also automatically generate memory and bound checks while allowing all C pointers operations. TCC can do these checks even if non patched libraries are used.\n\nWith libtcc, you can use TCC as a backend for dynamic code generation.", "updated": "2024-03-22T21:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/tinycc/0.9.26", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/tinycc/0.9.26", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html", "packageName": "tinycc", "displayName": "Tiny C Compiler", "summary": "TinyCC (aka TCC) is a small but hyper fast C compiler", "version": "0.9.26", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnthonyMastrean/chocolateypackages/049a54b5879eeef310cf0ce715c30887bec9ac96/public/icons/tinycc.png", "author": "Fabrice Bellard", "downloadCount": 2646, "tags": ["tinycc", "tcc", "compiler"]}
