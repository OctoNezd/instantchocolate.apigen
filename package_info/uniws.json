{"description": "Started by Wogg, and continued by Mird-OC and Arcus, the WSGF features the Universal Widescreen Patcher (UniWS for short). Games that use the UniWS go way beyond the .ini and Registry hacks that we are all used to. The UniWS patches .dll and .exe files found in several popular \"AAA\" titles.\n\nThe Patcher consists of two parts: The uniws.exe (which is the GUI interface and patcher), and the patches.ini file (which contains the game data to make the patch). You can download both here: uniws.zip.", "updated": "2024-03-23T23:33:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/uniws/1.03", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/uniws/1.03", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "uniws", "displayName": "Universal Widescreen Patcher", "summary": "universal widescreen patcher patches games to properly support widescreen resolutions", "version": "1.03", "icon": "http://www.wsgf.org/f/u/logo.png", "author": "Wogg", "downloadCount": 1549, "tags": ["universal", "widescreen", "patcher", "uniws", "widescreen-patcher", "widescreen-patch", "patch"]}
