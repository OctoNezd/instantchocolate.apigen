{"description": "## geany\nFeatures:Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment (IDE). It was developed\nto provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages. Another goal\nwas to be as independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME. So it is\nusing only the GTK2 toolkit and therefore you need only the GTK2 runtime libraries to run Geany.\n\n[Screenshots](http://www.geany.org/Documentation/Screenshots)\n[Plugins](http://www.geany.org/Support/Plugins)\n[Wiki](http://wiki.geany.org/)\n\n### Package-specific issue\nIf this package isn't up-to-date for some days, [Create an issue](https://github.com/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages/issues/new/choose)\n\nSupport the package maintainer and [![Patreon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@d15c4e19c709e7148588d4523ffc6dd3cd3c7e5e/icons/patreon.png)](https://www.patreon.com/tunisiano)", "updated": "2024-03-23T15:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/geany/2.0.0.20231106", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/geany/2.0.0.20231106", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/geany/geany/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "geany", "displayName": "Geany", "summary": "Fast and lightweight IDE", "version": "2.0.0.20231106", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@7cc8d197a0daa3297060d92a75902352d1cce156/icons/geany.png", "author": "Enrico Tr\u00f6ger,  Frank Lanitz,  Nick Treleaven and Dominic Hopf", "downloadCount": 30101, "tags": ["text", "editor", "ide", "scintilla", "admin"]}
