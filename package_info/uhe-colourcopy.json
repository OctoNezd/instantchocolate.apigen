{"description": "Colour Copy: a bucketful of delay\nA virtual analog effect inspired by classic bucket-brigade delays (BBD), but extended with modern features. We called our new baby \"Colour Copy\" because it can deliver the kind of colouration people still love in classic BBD units, but with a wider variety of colours. Colour Copy started life as the little delay unit called \"Lyrebird\" we built into Repro-1, but the sound was too good not to be developed further and become an FX plug-in.\n\n## Package Specific\n\n### Package Parameters\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n * `/NoVst2x86`       - Do not install the x86 VST2 version\n * `/NoVst2x64`       - Do not install the x64 VST2 version\n * `/NoVst3x86`       - Do not install the x86 VST3 version\n * `/NoVst3x64`       - Do not install the x64 VST3 version\n * `/NoAaxx86`        - Do not install the x86 AAX version\n * `/NoAaxx64`        - Do not install the x64 AAX version\n * `/NoPresets`       - Do not install factory presets\n * `/NoNks`           - Do not install the nks integration\n * `/Vst2Path:`       - Installation path of the VST2 version\n * `/Vst2x86Path:`    - Installation path of the x86 VST2 version on x64 CPU architecture\n * `/UserFolderPath:` - Path of the user data (presets, settings, themes) to link outside factory data (optional)\n * `/CompanyPath:`    - Path of the company to put all program files in.
