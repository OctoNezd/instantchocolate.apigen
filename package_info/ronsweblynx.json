{"description": "Rons WebLynx is a powerful windows desktop bookmark manager to organize large numbers of websites links.\n\nLinks are added manually, automatically (Automatic Link Filing option) or may be imported from various sources (browser bookmarks, Outlook, Word documents or even entire websites) to be organized into tags and folders with a familiar tree lay-out.\n\nBookmarks can be rated with stars and tagged with colours. Their names and descriptions can be edited and notes also can be added. \n\nThe bookmarks validity is automatically checked, and the links content can be instantly viewed in an integrated browser or a content-only reading panel.\n\n Export WebLynx files, and link content, to share with other users.\n \nAll this power is presented with a clean and neat interface that is a pleasure to use. Rons WebLynx is simply a great tool for anyone who uses the Internet!\n\nFor more information, check https://www.ronsplace.ca/Products/RonsWebLynx.", "updated": "2024-03-22T04:03:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ronsweblynx/2024.1.26.1521", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ronsweblynx/2024.1.26.1521", "licenseUrl": "https://www.ronsplace.ca/Article/Pages/Business/user-license-agreement", "packageName": "ronsweblynx", "displayName": "Rons WebLynx (Install)", "summary": "Bookmark storage, sorting and organization.", "version": "2024.1.26.1521", "icon": "https://www.ronsplace.ca/ContentProduct/LINKR/Icon.png", "author": "Aaron Stewart,  Rons Place Software", "downloadCount": 124, "tags": ["bookmark", "link", "manager", "management", "organiser", "organizer", "rss", "atom", "reader", "feeds", "chrome", "firefox", "free", "desktop", "linkman", "web", "links", "tag", "validity", "check", "checking"]}
