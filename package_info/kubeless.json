{"description": "`kubeless` is a Kubernetes-native serverless framework that lets you deploy small bits of code without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure plumbing. It leverages Kubernetes resources to provide auto-scaling, API routing, monitoring, troubleshooting and more.\n\nKubeless stands out as we use a [Custom Resource Definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions/) to be able to create functions as custom kubernetes resources. We then run an in-cluster controller that watches these custom resources and launches _runtimes_ on-demand. The controller dynamically injects the functions code into the runtimes and make them available over HTTP or via a PubSub mechanism.\n\nKubeless is purely open-source and non-affiliated to any commercial organization. Chime in at anytime, we would love the help and feedback !\n\n## Tools\n\n- A [UI](https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless-ui) is available. It can run locally or in-cluster.\n- A [serverless framework plugin](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-kubeless) is available.\n\n## Quick start\n\nCheck out the instructions for quickly set up Kubeless [here](http://kubeless.io/docs/quick-start).\n\n## Building\n\nConsult the [developer's guide](docs/dev-guide.md) for a complete set of instruction\nto build kubeless.\n\n## Comparison\n\nThere are other solutions, like [fission](http://fission.io) and [funktion](https://github.com/fabric8io/funktion). There is also an incubating project at the ASF: [OpenWhisk](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk). We believe however, that Kubeless is the most Kubernetes native of all.\n\nKubeless uses k8s primitives, there is no additional API server or API router/gateway. Kubernetes users will quickly understand how it works and be able to leverage their existing logging and monitoring setup as well as their troubleshooting skills.\n\n## Compatibility Matrix with Kubernetes\n\nKubeless fully supports Kubernetes versions greater than 1.9 (tested until 1.15). For other versions some of the features in Kubeless may not be available. Our CI run tests against two different platforms: GKE (1.12) and Minikube (1.15). Other platforms are supported but fully compatibiliy cannot be assured.\n\n## _Roadmap_\n\nWe would love to get your help, feel free to lend a hand. We are currently looking to implement the following high level features:\n\n- Add other runtimes, currently Python, NodeJS, Ruby, PHP, .NET and Ballerina are supported. We are also providing a way to use custom runtime. Please check [this doc](./docs/runtimes.md) for more details.\n- Investigate other messaging bus (e.g SQS, rabbitMQ)\n- Optimize for functions startup time\n- Add distributed tracing (maybe using istio)\n\n## Community\n\n**Issues**: If you find any issues, please [file it](https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless/issues).\n\n**Slack**: We're fairly active on [slack](http://slack.k8s.io) and you can find us in the #kubeless channel.", "updated": "2024-03-17T13:48:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/kubeless/1.0.8", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/kubeless/1.0.8", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "kubeless", "displayName": "Kubeless CLI", "summary": "kubeless is a Kubernetes-native serverless framework that lets you deploy small bits of code without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure plumbing", "version": "1.0.8", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/jtcmedia/chocolatey-packages/41e2676c630eda8655474b38eca6d4353aa27907/icons/kubeless.png", "author": "Bitnami", "downloadCount": 1129, "tags": ["kubeless", "cli", "serverless", "kubernetes", "faas", "functions", "function", "python", "nodejs", "node", "ruby", "php", ".net", "ballerina"]}
