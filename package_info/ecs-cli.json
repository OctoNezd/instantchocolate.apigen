{"description": "# Amazon ECS CLI\n\nThe Amazon ECS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a command line tool for Amazon Elastic Container\nService (Amazon ECS) that provides high-level commands to simplify creating, updating, and\nmonitoring clusters and tasks from a local development environment. The Amazon ECS CLI supports\n[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), a popular open-source tool for defining and\nrunning multi-container applications. Use the CLI as part of your everyday development and testing\ncycle as an alternative to the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.\n\nFor more information about Amazon ECS, see the [Amazon ECS Developer\nGuide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html).\n\nThe AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified client for AWS services that provides commands\nfor all public API operations. These commands are lower level than those provided by the Amazon ECS\nCLI. For more information about supported services and to download the AWS CLI, see the [AWS Command\nLine Interface](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/) product detail page.\n\n- [Installing](#installing)\n  - [Latest version](#latest-version)\n  - [Download Links for within China](#download-links-for-within-china)\n  - [Download specific version](#download-specific-version)\n  - [Verifying Signatures](#verifying-signatures)\n- [Configuring the CLI](#configuring-the-cli)\n  - [ECS Profiles](#ecs-profiles)\n  - [Cluster Configurations](#cluster-configurations)\n  - [Configuring Defaults](#configuring-defaults)\n- [Using the CLI](#using-the-cli)\n  - [Creating an ECS Cluster](#creating-an-ecs-cluster)\n    - [Creating a Fargate cluster](#creating-a-fargate-cluster)\n  - [Starting/Running Tasks](#startingrunning-tasks)\n  - [Creating a Service](#creating-a-service)\n  - [Using ECS parameters](#using-ecs-parameters)\n    - [Launching an AWS Fargate task](#launching-an-aws-fargate-task)\n    - [Using Route53 Service Discovery](#using-route53-service-discovery)\n  - [Viewing Running Tasks](#viewing-running-tasks)\n  - [Viewing Container Logs](#viewing-container-logs)\n  - [Using FIPS Endpoints](#using-fips-endpoints)\n  - [Using Private Registry Authentication](#using-private-registry-authentication)\n  - [Checking for Missing Attributes and Debugging Reason Attribute Errors](#checking-for-missing-attributes-and-debugging-reason-attribute-errors)\n  - [Tagging Resources](#tagging-resources)\n    - [ARN Formats](#arn-formats)\n  - [Running Tasks Locally](#running-tasks-locally)\n- [Amazon ECS CLI Commands](#amazon-ecs-cli-commands)\n- [Contributing to the CLI](#contributing-to-the-cli)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Security disclosures\n\nIf you think you\u2019ve found a potential security issue, please do not post it in the Issues.
