{"description": "The InternetExplorerDriver is a standalone server which implements WebDriver's wire protocol. This driver has been tested with IE 6, 7, 8 and 9 on appropriate combinations of XP, Vista and Windows 7.\n\nThe driver supports running 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the browser. The choice of how to determine which \"bit-ness\" to use in launching the browser depends on which version of the IEDriverServer.exe is launched. If the 32-bit version of IEDriverServer.exe is launched, the 32-bit version of IE will be launched. Similarly, if the 64-bit version of IEDriverServer.exe is launched, the 64-bit version of IE will be launched.", "updated": "2024-03-16T23:05:42Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/IEDriverServer/2.32.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/IEDriverServer/2.32.3", "licenseUrl": "https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/", "packageName": "IEDriverServer", "displayName": "IEDriverServer", "summary": "The InternetExplorerDriver is a standalone server which implements WebDriver's wire protocol", "version": "2.32.3", "icon": "", "author": "Chromium and WebDriver teams", "downloadCount": 298951, "tags": ["IEDriverServer", "IEDriver", "ie", "internet", "explorer", "webdriver", "selenium"]}
