{"description": "CLI hash (checksum) utility.\nValid inputs:\n - filePath [hash algorithm name]\n  => returns the file hash as a hexadecimal string.\n  the default algorithm is md5.\n - filePath [hash to test against (hexadecimal string)]\n  => calculate and compare the hash of the file against the provided hash.\n  the algorithm is automatically determined based on the length of the string.\n\nIf no file path is provided, the program will try to read from the standard input stream.\n\nTo force an argument to be interpreted as an input file path, put it between quotes.\n\nSupported Algorithms:\n - MD5\n - SHA1\n - SHA256\n - SHA384\n - SHA512", "updated": "2024-03-22T15:03:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/hasher/1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/hasher/1.0", "licenseUrl": "http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT", "packageName": "hasher", "displayName": "Hasher", "summary": "CLI hash (checksum) utility.", "version": "1.0", "icon": "http://arcanesanctum.net/wp-content/uploads/hasher/terminal.jpg", "author": "Melvyn Laily", "downloadCount": 1580, "tags": ["file", "hasher", "hash", "tool", "checksum", "md5", "sha1", "utility", "cli", "command-line"]}
