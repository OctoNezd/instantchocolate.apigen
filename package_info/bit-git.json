{"description": "`bit` is an experimental modernized git CLI built on top of git that provides happy defaults and other niceties:\n\n- command and **flag suggestions** to help you navigate the plethora of options git provides you\n- autocompletion for files and branch names when using \n`bit add` or `bit checkout`\n- automatic fetch and **branch fast-forwarding** reducing the likelihood of merge conflicts \n- suggestions **work with git aliases**\n- new commands like `bit sync` that vastly simplify your workflow \n- commands from **git-extras** such as `bit release` & `bit info`\n- **fully compatible with git** allowing you to fallback to git if need be.  \n- get insight into how bit works using `bit --debug`.\n\n--- **New** ---\n\n- [X] `bit pr` view and checkout pull requests from Github (Requires GitHub CLI) \n- [X] easily update bit using `bit update`\n- [X] single binary (no more bitcomplete) add classical tab completion with `bit complete`\n\n\n--- **Coming Soon** ---\n- improved `bit sync`\n- more completions!\n\n\n*Note*: On Windows only the interactive prompt completion works not classic tab completion\n\nVerify installation with:\n\n`bit`\n\nDependencies: Git\n\nPlatform Support:\n- iTerm2 (macOS)\n- Terminal.app (macOS)\n- Command Prompt (Windows)\n- WSL/Windows Subsystem for Linux (Windows)\n- gnome-terminal (Ubuntu)\n\nCustomization: \n- `BIT_THEME=inverted`\n- `BIT_THEME=monochrome`\n\n## Bit specific command Usage \n\nCreate a new commit\n\n`bit save [commit message]`\n\nSave your changes to the current branch [amends current commit when ahead of origin]\n\n`bit save` \n\nSynchronize your changes to origin branch (Beta)\n\n`bit sync`\n\nYou have access to ALL git commands as well.  \n\n`bit commit -m \"I can still use git commands\"`, `bit pull -r origin master`\n\n## Example Workflow\n`bit switch example-branch`\nBranch does not exist. Do you want to create it? Y/n\n\nyes\n\nSwitched to a new branch 'example-branch'\n\n[Makes some changes]\n\n`bit save \"add important feature\"` \n\n*for multiline commits simply don't put the final quote until you're done typing*\n\n[fix an error for important feature]\n\n`bit save`\n\n[push changes to origin]\n\n`bit sync`\n\n[two days later confirm your branch is in sync with origin]\n\n`bit sync`\n\n\n## Features\n\n- Automatic fetching & fast forwarding to keep your branches up to date and prevent merge conflicts\n- Simplify your entire rebase workflow with a single command `bit sync` \n- Automatic suggestions at your fingertips \n- `bit` is **fully compatible** with `git`. All features of git are available if need be.  \n\n## Inspiration\n\nThanks to [Gitless](https://gitless.com/), [git-extras](https://github.com/tj/git-extras), researchers in the field and of course the developers of `git` itself!
