{"description": "arxiv-collector for Windows - A little Python script to collect LaTeX sources for upload to the arXiv.\n\n## Usage\n\nUse with `arxiv-collector` from your project's main directory, or `arxiv-collector file.tex` if you have more than one .tex file and it can't guess correctly which one to use; `arxiv-collector --help` for more.\n\n## Requirements:\n\n* A working installation of [`latexmk`](http://personal.psu.edu/jcc8/software/latexmk/), on your PATH. (This is used to make the `.bbl` file and to track which files are used.)\n  * If you have working TeX and Perl installations, you likely already have `latexmk` even if you don't use it. If you don't, you can either install it the \"normal\" way (`tmlgr install latexmk`, `apt-get install latexmk`, ...), or just grab the script with `arxiv-collector --get-latexmk path/to/output/latexmk`.\n  * If `latexmk` isn't on your PATH for whatever reason, add `--latexmk ./path/to/latexmk` to your `arxiv-collector` call.\n  * **NOTE:** `latexmk` version 4.63b has broken dependency tracking, which means `arxiv-collector` won't work with it. You can either update it with your package manager, or you can get a working version, e.g. 4.64a, with `arxiv-collector --get-latexmk path/to/output/latexmk`, and either put it in e.g. `~/bin` or pass `--latexmk` to your `arxiv-collector` invocations.\n\n\n## Caveats\n\nThe script may or may not work if you do something weird with your project layout / etc; always check that the arXiv output pdf looks right. [Let me know](https://github.com/djsutherland/arxiv-collector/issues/new) if you run into any problems, including a copy of the not-working project if possible.\n\nIn particular, if you include figures or other files with absolute paths (`\\includegraphics{/home/me/wow.png}` instead of `\\includegraphics{../wow.png}`), the script will think it's a system file and not include it by default. You can hack it with `--include-packages` to include any directory name in the path.", "updated": "2024-03-06T21:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/arxiv-collector/0.4.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/arxiv-collector/0.4.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/djsutherland/arxiv-collector/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "arxiv-collector", "displayName": "arxiv-collector", "summary": "arxiv-collector for Windows", "version": "0.4.1", "icon": "", "author": "Danica J.
