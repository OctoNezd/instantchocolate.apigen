{"description": "Visual Studio Code Remote Development Extension Pack\n\nThe Remote Development extension pack allows you to open any folder in a container, on a remote machine, or in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and take advantage of VS Code's full feature set. Since this lets you set up a full-time development environment anywhere, you can:\n\n    Develop on the same operating system you deploy to or use larger, faster, or more specialized hardware than your local machine.\n    Quickly swap between different, separate development environments and make updates without worrying about impacting your local machine.\n    Help new team members / contributors get productive quickly with easily spun up, consistent development containers.\n    Take advantage of a Linux based tool-chain right from the comfort of Windows from a full-featured development tool.\n\nNo source code needs to be on your local machine to gain these benefits since Remote Development runs commands and extensions directly on the remote machine.", "updated": "2024-03-20T14:03:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vscode-remote-development/0.23.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vscode-remote-development/0.23.0", "licenseUrl": "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack/license", "packageName": "vscode-remote-development", "displayName": "Remote-Development VSCode Extension Pack", "summary": "VSCode extension pack for Remote Development", "version": "0.23.0", "icon": "https://github.com/simeononsecurity/chocolateypackages/blob/main/VSCode-Remote-Development/logos/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Icons.png", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 263, "tags": ["vscode-development", "development", "remote", "extension", "vscode"]}
