{"description": "IOProtocolExt is a plugin for KeePass 2.x that adds support for loading/saving files from/to servers using the SCP (Secure CoPy) protocol, SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) and FTPS (FTP over SSH).\n\nKeePass can handle FTP by default (using classes of the .NET framework). However, this plugin replaces the FTP handler to use WinSCP instead. So, if you had problems with the .NET FTP classes, installing IOProtocolExt might solve them.", "updated": "2024-03-19T06:18:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/keepass-plugin-ioprotocolext/1.16", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/keepass-plugin-ioprotocolext/1.16", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "packageName": "keepass-plugin-ioprotocolext", "displayName": "KeePass Plugin IOProtocolExt", "summary": "Plugin for KeePass 2.x to add support for loading/saving files from/to servers", "version": "1.16", "icon": "", "author": "Dominik Reichl", "downloadCount": 3834, "tags": ["keepass", "plugin", "scp", "sftp", "ftps"]}
