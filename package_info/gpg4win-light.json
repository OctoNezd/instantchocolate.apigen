{"description": "**NOTE**: This GPG distribution is no longer maintained. Instead, use [gpg4win](https://chocolatey.org/packages/gpg4win) which is since v3.0 significantly lighter than what it was previously or [gnupg](https://chocolatey.org/packages/gnupg) which provides the modern command line version of GnuPG without any graphical tools.\n\n---\n\nGpg4win-light (GNU Privacy Guard for Windows) is a suite of programs for file encryption and digital signatures, excluding the documentation and Kleopatra, the GUI certificate manager and encryption/signature tool.\n\nGpg4win enables users to securely transport emails and files with the help of encryption and digital signatures. Encryption protects the contents against an unwanted party reading it. Digital signatures allow authors of files to sign them prior to distribution so a user may verify the file has not been tampered with and comes from a specific sender.\n\nGpg4win supports both relevant cryptography standards, [OpenPGP](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880.txt) and Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) X.509 certificates, and is the official GnuPG distribution for Windows.\n\nIt is maintained by the developers of GnuPG. Gpg4win and the software included with Gpg4win are Free Software (Open Source; among other things free of charge for all commercial and non-commercial purposes).\n\n## Features\n\n* Supports OpenPGP and S/MIME\n* High algorithmic strength of GnuPG\n* SmartCards for OpenPGP and S/MIME\n* Sign single files or complete folders directly from the Windows Explorer with GpgEX or Kleopatra\n* Create and verify checksums of files directly from the Windows Explorer or Kleopatra\n* Outlook email plugin\n* User-friendly Certificate Selection and management\n* Import and export of certificates from and to (OpenPGP and X.509) certificate servers\n\nMore information:\n\n* [Features](http://www.gpg4win.org/features.html)\n* [Screenshots](http://www.gpg4win.org/screenshots.html)\n* [Privacy policy](http://www.gpg4win.org/privacy-policy.html)\n* Community: [Forum](http://wald.intevation.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=21), [IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/#gpg4win)\n\n## Notes\n\nGpg4win is distributed in three editions and available by the following chocolatey packages:\n\n### [gpg4win-vanilla](https://chocolatey.org/packages/gpg4win-vanilla)\n\n* [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/faq/gnupg-faq.html#general)\nThe backend (command-line interface); this is the actual encryption and digital signature tool used by the other software in the suite.\n\n### [gpg4win-light](https://chocolatey.org/packages/gpg4win-light)\n\nIncludes all the above, and:\n\n* [GNU Privacy Assistant (GPA)](https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpa/index.html)\nAn alternative program for managing OpenPGP and X.509 (S/MIME) certificates.\n* [GnuPG for Outlook (GpgOL)](http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=gpgol.git;a=summary)\nA plugin for the 32bit versions of Microsoft Outlook 2003/2007/2010/2013 (email encryption).
