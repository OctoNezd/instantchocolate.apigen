If you're anything like me, (probably not as I've been told the mold was broken) now and then you see a package upgraded and wonder why you have it installed since you can't remember the last time you ran the program or what it's even for. This little pre-install hook will show you the (description) summary of the package before the package installs. So now you'll know and have something to read as you watch the download.\n\n## Choco-Package-Info Hooks Collection:\n[choco-package-info-description.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-package-info-description.hook) - displays package description before install\n[choco-package-info-summary.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-package-info-summary.hook) - displays package summary before install\n[choco-package-info-releasenotes.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-package-info-releasenotes.hook) - displays package release notes before install\n\n**If you like this little hook, please consider donating: https://www.paypal.me/bcurran3donations or become a patron at https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3**", "updated": "2024-03-22T01:33:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-package-info-summary.hook/1.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/choco-package-info-summary.hook/1.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html", "packageName": "choco-package-info-summary.hook", "displayName": "(unofficial) Choco Package Info Summary (Pre-Install Hook)", "summary": "choco-package-info-summary.hook displays the summary of the package you are installing or upgrading right before it happens.", "version": "1.0.0", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/mylogos/mychocohooks_icon.png", "author": "bcurran3", "downloadCount": 77, "tags": ["bcurran3", "unofficial", "choco", "package-info", "hook"]}
