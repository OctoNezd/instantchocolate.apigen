{"description": "MyPaint is a nimble, distraction-free, and easy tool for digital painters. It supports graphics tablets made by Wacom, and many similar devices. Its brush engine is versatile and configurable, and it provides useful, productive tools.\n\nThe standard brushes can emulate traditional media like charcoal, pencils, ink, or paint. But you don\u2019t have to limit yourself to just the standard ones. It\u2019s easy to make expressive, artful new brushes that don\u2019t respond like anything conventional.\n      \nFullscreen mode declutters the interface, leaving you with just your brush and your creativity. You can still reveal the tools you want, when you need them. This distraction-free approach means you can focus better on the art you make, not the tool you make it with.\n      \nMyPaint has simplicity, yet it gives you all the tools you need to create great artwork.", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:03:53Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/mypaint/2.0.1.20220704", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/mypaint/2.0.1.20220704", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/blob/master/Licenses.md", "packageName": "mypaint", "displayName": "MyPaint", "summary": "MyPaint is a simple drawing and painting program that works well with Wacom-style graphics tablets.", "version": "2.0.1.20220704", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/mypaint/mypaint/1e01206a10820934ea2a805ec5a60091490f172e/pixmaps/mypaint_logo.png", "author": "MyPaint", "downloadCount": 4624, "tags": ["mypaint", "art", "design", "graphics", "paint", "sketch"]}
