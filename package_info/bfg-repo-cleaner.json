{"description": "# The BFG Repo Cleaner\n\nThe BFG is a simpler, faster alternative to `git filter-branch` for cleansing bad data out of your Git repository history:\n\n* Removing Crazy Big Files\n* Removing Passwords, Credentials & other Private data\n\nThe `git filter-branch` command is enormously powerful and can do things that the BFG can't, but the BFG is much better for the tasks above, because:\n\n* It's faster: 10 - 720x faster\n* It's simpler: The BFG isn't particularily clever, but is focused on making the above tasks easy\n* It's beautiful: If you need to, you can use the beautiful Scala language to customise the BFG. Which has got to be better than Bash scripting at least some of the time.\n\nThis package contains a precompiled version of The BFG, with all dependencies included in the JAR file, as well as a Windows command-line executable that runs The BFG.", "updated": "2024-03-22T21:19:02Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/bfg-repo-cleaner/1.13.0.20200108", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/bfg-repo-cleaner/1.13.0.20200108", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/wjk/BFG-Windows/blob/master/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "bfg-repo-cleaner", "displayName": "The BFG", "summary": "The BFG removes large and troublesome blobs from your repo", "version": "1.13.0.20200108", "icon": "", "author": "Roberto Tyley", "downloadCount": 6378, "tags": ["git", "java"]}
