{"description": "Free42 is a re-implementation of the HP-42S Scientific Programmable\n        Calculator and HP-82240 Printer. It is a complete rewrite, not using any\n        HP code. It does not require an HP-42S ROM image. Even though it\n        contains significant enhancements compared to the original calculator,\n        Free42 remains fully compatible with the HP-42S, both in its user\n        interface and in its ability to run programs written for the HP-42S.", "updated": "2024-03-22T19:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/free42/3.1.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/free42/3.1.4", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "packageName": "free42", "displayName": "Free42 (Portable)", "summary": "An HP-42S Calculator Simulator", "version": "3.1.4", "icon": "http://rawcdn.githack.com/WetHat/chocolatey-packages/master/free42/hp42s192x192.png", "author": "Thomas Okken", "downloadCount": 1393, "tags": ["hp42s", "calculator", "simulation", "portable"]}
