{"description": "Tor is a connection-oriented anonymizing communication service. Users choose a source-routed path through a set of nodes, and negotiate a \"virtual circuit\" through the network, in which each node knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing down the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node, which reveals the downstream node.\n\nBasically, Tor provides a distributed network of servers or relays (\"onion routers\"). Users bounce their TCP streams -- web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc. -- around the network, and recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty tracking the source of the stream.\n\nThe way most people use Tor is with [Tor Browser](https://chocolatey.org/packages/tor-browser), which is a feature-stripped version of Firefox.\n\nThis package provides a command-line interface for creating Tor clients and configuring relay services.\n\n#### Documentation\n* [FAQ](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html)\n* [Wiki](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki)\n* [Sample.torrc](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/plain/src/config/torrc.sample.in)", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/tor/0.4.8.10", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/tor/0.4.8.10", "licenseUrl": "https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/LICENSE", "packageName": "tor", "displayName": "Tor", "summary": "Anonymizing overlay network for TCP", "version": "0.4.8.10", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dtgm/chocolatey-packages@007624f9eb18e2256d53e5080c6e7d857674b7ea/icons/tor.png", "author": "Tor Project", "downloadCount": 91730, "tags": ["tor", "relay", "privacy", "anonymity", "security", "onion", "network", "service", "cli"]}
