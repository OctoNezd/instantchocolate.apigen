{"description": "PSCodeHealth allows you to measure the quality and maintainability of your PowerShell code, based on a variety of metrics related to:\n\n* Code length\n* Code complexity\n* Code smells, styling issues and violations of best practices\n* Tests and test coverage\n* Comment-based help\n\nIt can allow you to ensure that your code is compliant with metrics goals (quality gates). You can use the default (built-in) compliance rules, and you can also customize some (or all) compliance rules to fit your goals.\n\nThese features can be leveraged from within your PowerShell release pipeline.\n\nPSCodeHealth can also generate a highly visual HTML report so that you can interpret the results at a glance, and easily share them.\n\n**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pscodehealth/0.2.26", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pscodehealth/0.2.26", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/MathieuBuisson/PSCodeHealth/blob/master/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "pscodehealth", "displayName": "PSCodeHealth (PowerShell Module)", "summary": "PSCodeHealth allows you to measure the quality and maintainability of your PowerShell code, based on a variety of metrics.", "version": "0.2.26", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/pauby/ChocoPackages/67812184/icons/pscodehealth.png", "author": "Mathieu Buisson", "downloadCount": 4757, "tags": ["admin", "powershell", "module", "code", "analysis", "health", "report"]}
