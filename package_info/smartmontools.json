{"description": "S.M.A.R.T. Monitoring Tools (smartmontools) package contains two utility programs (smartctl and smartd) to control and monitor storage systems using the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology System (SMART) built into most modern ATA and SCSI harddisks.\n\nSmartmontools was originally derived from the Linux \u200bsmartsuite package and actually supports ATA/ATAPI/SATA-3 to -8 disks and SCSI disks and tape devices. It should run on any modern Darwin (Mac OS X), Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, OS/2, Cygwin, QNX, eComStation or Windows system. Smartmontools can also be run from one of many different Live CDs/DVDs.\n\nDue to OS-specific issues and also depending on the different state of smartmontools development on the platforms, device support is not the same for all OS platforms. We provide info about RAID-controller support here on the homepage and of course in the manpages.\n\nSee [GSmartControl](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gsmartcontrol) for a GTK GUI interface.\n\n#### Documentation\n\n* [FAQ](http://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/FAQ)\n* [Manual](http://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/TocDoc)\n* [Developer](http://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/TocDeveloper)\n\n**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package.
