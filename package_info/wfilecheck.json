{"description": "This file integrity checker uses Alternate Data Streams to store the hashes of your files. So, it only works on NTFS volumes. With that, you can rename, copy or move your files (to another NTFS volume) without losing the hashes, and without needing to do anything else.\n\nThe Whirlpool algorithm is a strong 512-bit hash function. This tool uses an optimized implementation for 64-bit and SSE4.1 when available.\n\nEach folder is recursively processed. You can use drag-and-drop, mix files and folders, pause and resume.\n\nFor better performances, the 64-bit version is highly recommended.\n\nMinimum requirement: Windows XP or later.", "updated": "2024-03-22T23:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/wfilecheck/0.5", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/wfilecheck/0.5", "licenseUrl": "http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Public_domain", "packageName": "wfilecheck", "displayName": "Whirlpool File Checker", "summary": "File integrity checker uses Alternate Data Streams to store the hashes of your files", "version": "0.5", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@43e158f1c4f37fcd462ee701c43f34f12211c53d/icons/wfilecheck.png", "author": "vampire77", "downloadCount": 1385, "tags": ["whirlpool", "file", "integrity", "checksum"]}
