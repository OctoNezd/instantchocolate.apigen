Be it a bunch of friends having a LAN party, or a large corporation - instant messaging makes working together easy. Unfortunately, existing instant messengers allow users to communicate with the entire planet, not just your local network.\n\nTonic changes this. With Tonic, you get all of the convenience, versatility and power of instant messaging, with none of the interference. Ideal for the smallest home network to the largest corporation.\n\nTonic features the ability to have icons that can represent your feeling, mood, or character. You can use any of the hundreds of included icons or create your own, which will be automatically sent to other users on the network.\n\n####Tonic has been Archived\n\nTonic is no longer under active development and has been Archived.\n\nIt is possible that sometime in the future, development will be re-started.\n\nPACKAGING NOTE: Uninstall is NOT silent.", "updated": "2024-03-23T18:48:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/tonic/1.0.990", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/tonic/1.0.990", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "tonic", "displayName": "Tonic (Install)", "summary": "Tonic is an instant messenger client intended to be used only on a private LAN.", "version": "1.0.990", "icon": "", "author": "Cliff Cawley", "downloadCount": 947, "tags": ["tonic", "chat", "IM", "messenger", "admin"]}
