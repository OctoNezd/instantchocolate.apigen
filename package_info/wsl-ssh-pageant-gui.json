{"description": "A Pageant to TCP bridge for use with WSL, allowing for Pageant to be used as an ssh-ageant within the WSL environment.\n\nThe difference between the gui.exe binary and the regular binaries is the subsystem as set in the PE header. \n- The gui.exe binary is set with the Win32 subsystem so that it doesn't spawn a command line, allowing it to be launched on startup. \n- The regular binary has the console subsystem so it does launch a command line if double clicked, and will block the command line as expected.\n\n**Note:** You may launch either binary with the -systray flag to have a systray icon whilst the tool is running, this only provides a way to quit the application.", "updated": "2024-03-22T21:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/wsl-ssh-pageant-gui/20201121.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/wsl-ssh-pageant-gui/20201121.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/benpye/wsl-ssh-pageant/blob/golang/LICENSE", "packageName": "wsl-ssh-pageant-gui", "displayName": "wsl-ssh-pageant (GUI)", "summary": "A Pageant to TCP bridge for use with WSL", "version": "20201121.2", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/niks255/ChocolateyPackages/master/wsl-ssh-pageant/icon.png", "author": "Ben Pye", "downloadCount": 781, "tags": ["wsl", "pageant", "ssh"]}
