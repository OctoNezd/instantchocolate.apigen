{"description": "The PerfectXL Excel compare tool is user friendly, easy to understand, and will quickly become an unmissable part of your work with Excel. It was designed in collaboration with a large set of varying Excel users, experts, beginners, and users in major financial institutions.\n\nThe program compares two Excel sheets for differences between the two versions and provides users a detailed overview of findings. It tracks differences back to user actions, reporting only true changes.\n\nThe speed, accuracy, and completeness are largely due to a fundamental spreadsheet comparison research done by the TU Delft. The user friendly interface is based on user tests and best practices.\n\nThis software is only available in a 64-bits version.", "updated": "2024-03-19T18:18:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/perfectxl-compare/1.0.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/perfectxl-compare/1.0.3", "licenseUrl": "https://go.perfectxl.com/terms-of-service/", "packageName": "perfectxl-compare", "displayName": "PerfectXL Compare", "summary": "PerfectXL Compare for Spreadsheet Comparison", "version": "1.0.3", "icon": "https://go.perfectxl.com/compare/icon.png", "author": "Infotron BV", "downloadCount": 596, "tags": ["excel", "compare", "diff", "admin"]}
