{"description": "This simple yet powerful security tool displays who has what access to directories, files and Registry keys on your systems. Use it to find holes in your permissions.\n\nWhile the flexible security model employed by Windows NT-based systems allows full control over security and file permissions, managing permissions so that users have appropriate access to files, directories and Registry keys can be difficult. There's no built-in way to quickly view user accesses to a tree of directories or keys. AccessEnum gives you a full view of your file system and Registry security settings in seconds, making it the ideal tool for helping you for security holes and lock down permissions where necessary.", "updated": "2024-03-20T19:18:43Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/accessenum/1.32", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/accessenum/1.32", "licenseUrl": "https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb469936", "packageName": "accessenum", "displayName": "AccessEnum", "summary": "Displays who has what access to directories, files and Registry keys on your systems", "version": "1.32", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/cf1efc0aac843672fbf1ca0e15082e4e11357df9/icons/accessenum.png", "author": "Bryce Cogswell", "downloadCount": 1451, "tags": ["permissions", "security", "sysinternals", "gui"]}
