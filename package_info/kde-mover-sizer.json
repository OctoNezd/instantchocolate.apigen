{"description": "[KDE Mover-Sizer](http://corz.org/windows/software/accessories/KDE-resizing-moving-for-Windows.php) (created with [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com)) makes it easy to move and resize windows without having to position your mouse cursor accurately.\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply hold down the Alt key, and click or drag anywhere on the window. During move or resize, use Shift to lock movements horizontally or vertically. During move or resize, release, press and hold Alt to quick-fit window into grid. Move mouse to select window position and size.\n\n### The shortcuts\n\n* Alt + Left Button -> Drag to move a window.\n* Alt + Right Button -> Drag to resize a window.\n* Alt + Middle Button -> Maximize/Restore a window.\n* Double-Alt + Left Button -> Minimize a window.\n* Double-Alt + Right Button -> Maximize/Restore a window.  \n* Double-Alt + Middle Button -> Close a window.\n\nThe Double-Alt modifier is activated by pressing the Alt key twice, much like a double-click. Hold the second Alt-press down until you click the mouse button. Tada!\n\nFor more, see menu and tray info balloons. For even more, edit the INI file and the [AddOns] section.\n\nIf it doesn't work on all windows, try to run KDE Mover-Sizer with elevation:\n\n`powershell Start-Process 'KDE Mover-Sizer.exe' -Verb RunAs`", "updated": "2024-03-21T02:48:41Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/kde-mover-sizer/2.9", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/kde-mover-sizer/2.9", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "kde-mover-sizer", "displayName": "KDE Mover-Sizer", "summary": "KDE Mover-Sizer makes it easy to move and resize windows.", "version": "2.9", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/IdealChain/chocolatey-packages/fde305ea9aa75d505b25e8083db9d08f6ec69ba3/icons/kde-mover-sizer.png", "author": "corz.org", "downloadCount": 1235, "tags": ["kde", "mover-sizer", "move", "resize", "windows"]}
