{"description": "ReQrypt is a tool for tunneling and encrypting web browser requests to hide\nthem from local (e.g. router-level, or ISP-level) snooping and interception.\nReQrypt is useful for bypassing ISP-level URL censorship/filtering/logging\nsystems.\n\nOrdinarily, the HTTP request is sent directly to the web server, unencrypted.\nThis means it may be read and/or intercepted by a local eavesdropper, such as\nyour ISP, workplace, or shared family router.  However, with ReQrypt the\noutgoing HTTP requests are encrypted and tunneled, rendering them unreadable\nto any local eavesdropper.\n\nReQrypt is effective against systems that only attack outbound HTTP requests\nonly, and ignore inbound HTTP responses.  Such systems are very common is\nISP-level censorship and logging systems, since processing URL traffic (HTTP\nrequests) is significantly easier than processing web page responses.\n\nFinally, unlike proxies, VPNs, Tor, etc., ReQrypt is not an anonymity tool.\nIt does not change the IP address of the tunneled packet.  This can be a good\nthing: it means the web responses are sent directly to your PC which means\nReQrypt is typically faster than these other systems.", "updated": "2024-03-23T00:48:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/reqrypt/1.4.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/reqrypt/1.4.1", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt", "packageName": "reqrypt", "displayName": "ReQrypt (Install)", "summary": "ReQrypt is a tool for tunneling and encrypting web browser requests to hide them from local (e.g. router-level, or ISP-level) snooping and interception.", "version": "1.4.1", "icon": "https://reqrypt.org/images/reqrypt.svg", "author": "basil", "downloadCount": 1555, "tags": ["reqrypt", "wfp", "windows-filtering-platform", "windivert", "dpi", "bypass", "dpi-bypass", "bypass-dpi", "censorship-circumvention", "anti-censorship", "anticensorship", "admin"]}
