{"description": "![screenshot of choco-protocol-support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/choco-protocol-support/choco-protocol-support_screenshot.png)\n\t\n# Implements installing of Chocolatey packages from the web using choco:// Protocol.\n\n### WHO IS THIS FOR?\n**choco-protocol-support** is designed for those who aren't comfortable with the Command Prompt or just don't like to type much. **choco-protocol-support** allows you to install Chocolatey packages by simply clicking choco:// URLs in your web browser. **choco-protocol-support** is also useful for support professionals who know the difficulty of getting end users to type in commands correctly. Now you can give end users a URL via e-mail or corporate software webpage to click and have a Chocolatey package installed!\n\nIf you like the convienance of this package, you should also check out [Install Chocolatey Packages from your Web Browser](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-install-packages-from-web-winconfig) which is very similar in concept as well as [(unofficial) Chocolatey Shortcuts (Config)](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-shortcuts-winconfig). All three of these make installing Chocolatey packages very user friendly.\n\n### HOW DOES IT WORK?\n**choco-protocol-support** configures Windows to use choco://packagename URLs and pass them along to **choco-protocol-support.ps1** which then processes the URL and runs \"choco install\" or \"choco upgrade\" to install or upgrade the package. [This ability will be baked natively into a future version of Chocolatey](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1680) and then this package can be retired.\n\n### USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\nJust click a choco://packagename URL on a web page and the package will install after one or two approval clicks. \nBrowser examples: [Chrome](https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/choco-protocol-support/choco-protocol-support_chrome_example.png) | [Firefox](https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/choco-protocol-support/choco-protocol-support_firefox_example.png) | [Opera](https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/choco-protocol-support/choco-protocol-support_opera_example.png)\n\n### **Easy peasy, Chocolateasy!**\n\n### INTRODUCING THE FIRST choco:// URLS ON THE INTERNET:\n(AKA Other fine 3rd party Chocolatey utilities by BCURRAN3)\n[choco://instchoco](choco://instchoco) - (unofficial) InstChoco - The ULTIMATE Chocolatey and Chocolatey packages (re)installer!\n[choco://choco-package-list-backup](choco://choco-package-list-backup) - (unofficial) Choco Package List Backup to Local and Cloud\n[choco://choco-cleaner](choco://choco-cleaner) - (unofficial) Choco Cleaner\n[choco://choco-upgrade-all-at](choco://choco-upgrade-all-at) - (unofficial) Choco Upgrade All at\n[choco://choco-shortcuts-winconfig](choco://choco-shortcuts-winconfig) - (unofficial) Chocolatey Shortcuts \n[choco://chocolatey-toast-notifications.extension](choco://chocolatey-toast-notifications.extension) - (unofficial) Chocolatey Toast Notifications \n[choco://chocolatey-preinstaller-checks.extension](choco://chocolatey-preinstaller-checks.extension) - (unofficial) Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks\n[choco://choco-install-packages-from-web-winconfig](choco://choco-install-packages-from-web-winconfig) - (unofficial) Install Chocolatey Packages from your Web Browser \n\n#### WARNING: Only install one package at a time until such time as Chocolatey is multi-instance aware or it will corrupt itself.
