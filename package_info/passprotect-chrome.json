PassProtect alerts you about breached credentials. Powered by \"Have I Been Pwned?\".\n\nPassProtect is a simple Chrome extension that dramatically improves your personal security when browsing the web. \n\nThere are a lot of passwords floating around the web because they were exposed in a data breach. Threat actors can use these exposed passwords to try to compromise your account \u2013 don't let them get in by using an exposed password!\n\nPassProtect works by checking your password against the fabulous Have I Been Pwned? API service (https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see whether or not the password you are using in any web login has been breached in the past. PassProtect uses 'k-anonymity', which ensures that your passwords are never seen, stored, or sent over the network during this checking process. You can learn more about k-anonymity by reading this excellent article: https://blog.cloudflare.com/validating-leaked-passwords-with-k-anonymity/\n\nPassProtect is a new, experimental way to help individual users play a more active role in protecting their online accounts. We believe that by informing and guiding users to reset their credentials when necessary, we can all help make the web a safer place!\n\t\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/passprotect-chrome/readme.md)**", "updated": "2024-03-22T07:03:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/passprotect-chrome/0.1.8", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/passprotect-chrome/0.1.8", "licenseUrl": "https://www.passprotect.io/legal/", "packageName": "passprotect-chrome", "displayName": "PassProtect for Chrome", "summary": "PassProtect is a simple Chrome extension that dramatically improves your personal security when browsing the web.", "version": "0.1.8", "icon": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7OPTe4hYj2sOetoREFOOykLgT1ezFBaiTVilxQa7ZisUXc9JZbmGUzIcThodLoREgNK0S1Q1=w128-h128-e365", "author": "Okta Developer", "downloadCount": 612, "tags": ["passprotect", "security", "password", "pwned", "chrome", "extension"]}
