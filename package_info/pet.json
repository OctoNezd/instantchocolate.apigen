{"description": "[pet_version]: https://img.shields.io/chocolatey/v/pet.svg\n[pet_package]: https://chocolatey.org/packages/pet\n\n`pet` is written in Go, and therefore you can just grab the binary releases and drop it in your $PATH.\n\n`pet` is a simple command-line snippet manager (inspired by [memo](https://github.com/mattn/memo)).\nI always forget commands that I rarely use. Moreover, it is difficult to search them from shell history. There are many similar commands, but they are all different.\n\ne.g.\n\n- `$ awk -F, 'NR <=2 {print $0}; NR >= 5 && NR <= 10 {print $0}' company.csv` (What I am looking for)\n- `$ awk -F, '$0 !~ \"DNS|Protocol\" {print $0}' packet.csv`\n- `$ awk -F, '{print $0} {if((NR-1) % 5 == 0) {print \"----------\"}}' test.csv`\n\nIn the above case, I search by `awk` from shell history, but many commands hit.\n\nEven if I register an alias, I forget the name of alias (because I rarely use that command).\n\nSo I made it possible to register snippets with description and search them easily.\n\n## Features\n\n`pet` has the following features.\n\n- Register your command snippets easily.\n- Use variables in snippets.\n- Search snippets interactively.\n- Run snippets directly.\n- Edit snippets easily (config is just a TOML file).\n- Sync snippets via Gist or GitLab Snippets automatically.", "updated": "2024-03-21T19:03:23Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pet/0.7.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pet/0.7.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/knqyf263/pet/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "pet", "displayName": "pet : CLI Snippet Manager", "summary": "Simple command-line snippet manager, written in Go.", "version": "0.7.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/knqyf263/pet/doc/logo.png", "author": "Teppei Fukuda", "downloadCount": 729, "tags": ["cli", "snippet"]}
