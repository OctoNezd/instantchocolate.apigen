If Markdown Edit does install with that reboot pending, it could encounter problems until the reboot is completed.\n* Markdown Edit is not supported for Windows 7.  It may work, but -- at a minimum -- the tool bar will be missing icons unless [the Win8+ version of Segoe UI Symbol font](http://www.askvg.com/fix-unknown-characters-or-vertical-rectangles-are-showing-in-place-of-metro-icons-in-windows-8-start-screen-and-login-screen/) is installed.
