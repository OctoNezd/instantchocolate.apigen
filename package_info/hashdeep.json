{"description": "Hashdeep is a set of cross-platform CLI tools to computer hashes, or message digests, for any number of files while optionally recursively digging through the directory structure. It can also take a list of known hashes and display the filenames of input files whose hashes either do or do not match any of the known hashes. This version supports MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, Tiger, and Whirlpool hashes.\n\nPreviously known as __md5deep__\n\n#### Community\n* [Forum](https://sourceforge.net/p/md5deep/discussion/)\n\n#### [Unicode issues](https://github.com/jessek/hashdeep#unicode-issues)\n\n#### Supported algorithms\n* MD5 algorithm is defined in [RFC 1321](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt)\n* SHA1 algorithm is defined in [FIPS 180-1](http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip180-1.htm)\n* SHA256 algorithm is defined [FIPS 180-2](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2.pdf)\n* Tiger algorithm is defined at http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/Reports/Tiger/\n* Whirlpool algorithm is defined at http://www.larc.usp.br/~pbarreto/WhirlpoolPage.html\n\n#### Command line usage\n  `hashdeep -h`\n  `md5deep -h`\n  `sha1deep -h`\n  `sha256deep -h`\n  `tigerdeep -h`\n  `whirlpooldeep -h`\n  \nNote: append `64` to above commands to execute the 64-bit version", "updated": "2024-03-21T19:48:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/hashdeep/4.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/hashdeep/4.4", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/jessek/hashdeep/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "hashdeep", "displayName": "hashdeep", "summary": "Recursively compute and match cryptographic hashes", "version": "4.4", "icon": "", "author": "Jesse Kornblum", "downloadCount": 5516, "tags": ["checksum", "file", "md5deep", "cli"]}
