{"description": "The Scanner provides a visualization of your media usage. To show the\n        relations optimally, all files and folders of the selected disk(s)\n        are displayed together in one diagram - with an area size proportional\n        to the used space. Smaller objects are invisible, of course. So the\n        Scanner is not intended to be a File Manager.", "updated": "2024-03-22T22:18:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/scanner/2.13.0.20151227", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/scanner/2.13.0.20151227", "licenseUrl": "http://www.steffengerlach.de/freeware/", "packageName": "scanner", "displayName": "Scanner", "summary": "The Scanner provides a visualization of your media usage.", "version": "2.13.0.20151227", "icon": "", "author": "Steffen Gerlach", "downloadCount": 3288, "tags": ["scanner", "admin", "disk", "usage"]}
