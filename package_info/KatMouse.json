{"description": "Freeing mouse wheel scrolling from the keyboard focus! The prime purpose of the KatMouse utility is to enhance the functionality of mice with a scroll wheel, offering 'universal' scrolling: moving the mouse wheel will scroll the window directly beneath the mouse cursor (not the one with the keyboard focus, which is default on Windows OSes). This is a major increase in the usefullness of the mouse wheel.\n    | Please install with chocolatey (http://nuget.org/List/Packages/chocolatey).", "updated": "2024-03-14T21:48:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/KatMouse/1.7", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/KatMouse/1.7", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "KatMouse", "displayName": "KatMouse", "summary": "Freeing mouse wheel scrolling from the keyboard focus!", "version": "1.7", "icon": "https://github.com/alanstevens/ChocoPackages/raw/master/KatMouse/KatMouse.png", "author": "Eduard Hiti", "downloadCount": 6172, "tags": ["KatMouse", "scroll", "chocolatey"]}
