{"description": "## Our Philosophy\nBuilt on modern open source technology, the KDevelop IDE offers a seamless development environment to programmers that work on projects of any size. It helps you get the job done while staying out of your way.\n\nAt the core of KDevelop lies the combination of an advanced editor with semantic code analysis, which delivers an enriched programming experience thanks to a deep understanding of your project. Additionally, KDevelop offers different workflows to assist the coder during the development process. It helps improve the code's quality, verify its functionality and then deploy it anywhere.\n\n## Free of Charge, Open Source\nKDevelop is available free of charge and is licensed under the GNU GPL.\nWe are a proud member of the KDE Community.\n\n## Extensible, Cross-Platform\nKDevelop is a feature-full, plugin extensible IDE for C/C++ and many other programming languages. Supported platforms include Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, macOS and other Unix flavors as well as Microsoft Windows. It is based on KDevelop Platform (kdevplatform), the KDE Frameworks and the Qt libraries. It is under development since 1998.\n\n## Running under Windows\nScreenshot of KDevelop 5 under Windows with the native Windows 10 style\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/kdevelop/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-23T13:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/kdevelop/5.6.2.1900", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/kdevelop/5.6.2.1900", "licenseUrl": "https://invent.kde.org/kdevelop/kdevelop/-/raw/master/COPYING.DOC", "packageName": "kdevelop", "displayName": "KDevelop", "summary": "KDevelop - A cross-platform IDE for C, C++, Python, QML/JavaScript and PHP", "version": "5.6.2.1900", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/kdevelop/kdevelop.png", "author": "KDevelop Team", "downloadCount": 14163, "tags": ["kdevelop", "KDE", "development", "ide"]}
