{"description": "SteaScree is a simple cross-platform open-source utility tool, which greatly simplifies the uploading of screenshots to the Steam Cloud, which were taken without the use of Steam's in-game overlay. You just pick pics, select game and SteaScree will do the rest.\n\n__The problem__: every Steam user has 20 GB of cloud space specifically for a screenshot storing. But not every screenshot can be easily uploaded to the Steam Cloud, since the files should have been created by Steam in-game overlay, thus have a specific filename, reside in specific Steam directories and be registered within a special screenshots.vdf file. Steam fails to upload custom screenshots returning Steam\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/steascree.install/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-05T19:03:36Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/steascree.install/1.5.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/steascree.install/1.5.4", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awthwathje/SteaScree/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "steascree.install", "displayName": "SteaScree: Steam Cloud Screenshot Uploader (Install)", "summary": "Steam Cloud Screenshot Uploader", "version": "1.5.4", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/steascree.install/steascree.install.png", "author": "SteaScree team", "downloadCount": 256, "tags": ["steascree.install", "screenshot", "upload", "Steam", "Cloud"]}
