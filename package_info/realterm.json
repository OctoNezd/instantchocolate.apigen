{"description": "Realterm is an engineers terminal program specially designed for capturing, controlling and debugging binary and other difficult data streams. It is the best tool for debugging comms.\n\n - Custom Timestamp format\n - Capture Restart and autonaming for long logging.\n - Post-Processing capture files \n - Code Signed Exe's and installer now for Win 7,8,10\n - Serial Ports, USB Serial and TCP/IP &  Telnet\n - I2C Bus, SPI& 1-Wire chip control via BL233B / I2C2PC\n - Binary viewed as hex, 8,16,32 bit,little/big endian, signed, unsigned, float\n - Fullscreen, MiniTerminal, Screen Scaling\n - Global Hotkeys (system-wide) to send strings\n - colorised: rx and tx data are different colors\n - ansi/VT100 terminal or plain text or binary modes\n - protocol analyser / \"portspying\" mode\n - fixed frame sizes/line lengths\n - sync patterns with masks and xors, and display only match data\n - Timestamps on pattern match or newlines\n - full remote control through activeX/COM\n - extensive command-line for batch files and INI files\n - can be used for serial I/O component of other programs via activeX. Full support for minimize,hide,iconize, tooltray\n - special ascii+hex font to see hidden control chars\n - capture to file, set capture size or capture duration\n - timestamping capture files for simple data logging\n - capture-restart, auto filenaming, data post-processing\n - view and change control lines(cts,rts, dcd etc)\n - easy to send binary sequences\n - arbitary baud rates\n - hideable to run in invisible or on tool-tray\n - Bluetooth BLE support for I2C2PC-BLE and HM10,11,15\n - reset / power buttons for PicProgrammer", "updated": "2024-03-23T00:03:34Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/realterm/2.0.0.7000", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/realterm/2.0.0.7000", "licenseUrl": "https://sourceforge.net/directory/license:bsd/", "packageName": "realterm", "displayName": "Realterm: serial terminal", "summary": "Serial/TCP Terminal", "version": "2.0.0.7000", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/Thieum/ChocolateyPackages/master/realterm/realterm.png", "author": "Crun", "downloadCount": 4797, "tags": ["vt100", "I2C", "SPI", "bl233b", "1-wire", "serial", "usb", "telnet", "RS232", "RS485", "TCP", "terminal", "admin"]}
