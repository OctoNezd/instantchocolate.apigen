{"description": "## Display Driver Uninstaller\nDisplay Driver Uninstaller is a driver removal utility that can help you completely \nremove Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) display card drivers and packages (AMD/NVIDIA) \nfrom your system without leaving leftovers behind; including registry keys, folders \nand files, services, and the driver store.\n\nThe AMD/NVIDIA video drivers can normally be uninstalled from the Windows Control \npanel, this driver uninstaller program was designed to be used in cases where the \nstandard driver uninstall fails, or whenever you need to thoroughly delete NVIDIA \nand ATI video card drivers.\n\nThe current effect after you use this driver removal will be similar as if its the \nfirst time you install a new driver just like a fresh, clean install of Windows. \nAs with any tool of this kind, we recommend creating a new system restore point \nbefore using it, so that you can revert your system at any time if you run into \nproblems.\n\n#### Usage\n* The tool can be used in Normal mode but for absolute stability when using DDU, Safe \nMode is always recommended.\n* Make a backup or a system restore. (but it should normally be pretty safe.)\n\n#### Community\n* [Forum - NVIDIA](https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/display-driver-uninstaller-thread.379506/)\n* [Forum - AMD](https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/display-driver-uninstaller-thread.379505/)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Wagnard)\n\n### Package-specific issue\nIf this package isn't up-to-date for some days, [Create an issue](https://github.com/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages/issues/new/choose)\n\nSupport the package maintainer and [![Patreon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@d15c4e19c709e7148588d4523ffc6dd3cd3c7e5e/icons/patreon.png)](https://www.patreon.com/tunisiano)", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:18:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ddu/18.0.7.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ddu/18.0.7.4", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/Wagnard/display-drivers-uninstaller/blob/WPF/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "ddu", "displayName": "Display Driver Uninstaller", "summary": "Utility to completely remove system drivers", "version": "18.0.7.4", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@7cc8d197a0daa3297060d92a75902352d1cce156/icons/ddu.png", "author": "Ghislain Harvey, Shady757", "downloadCount": 76662, "tags": ["driver", "uninstaller", "nvidia", "ati"]}
