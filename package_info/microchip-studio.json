{"description": "## Remark\n**microchip-studio is installed in 2 steps. The second step will be started automatically after a restart of the computer and will prompt you to install 2 certificates from:**\n- Microchip Technology, Inc.\n- Atmel Corporation.\n\n## Key Features\n- Support for 500+ AVR and SAM devices\n- Vast source code library, including drivers, communication stacks, 1,600+ project examples with source code, graphic services and touch functionality through Advanced Software Framework (ASF)\n- IDE extensions through Atmel Gallery, the online apps store, for development tools and embedded software from Microchip and third parties\n- Tune capacitive touch designs, validate system performance, monitor power consumption, and real-time data and trace graphing with Atmel QTouch Composer\n- Configure and test the performance of wireless designs with the Wireless Composer running on the target\n- Write and debug C/C++ and assembly code with the integrated compiler\n- Advanced debugging features include complex data breakpoints, nonintrusive trace support (SAM3 and SAM4 devices), statistical code profiling, interrupt trace/monitoring, polled data tracing (Cortex-M0+ devices), real-time variable tracking with optional timestamping.\n- Integrated editor with visual assist\n- Project wizard allowing projects created from scratch or from a large library of design examples\n- In-system programming and debugging provides interface to all Atmel in-circuit programmers and debuggers\n- Create transparent debug views into CPU and peripherals for easy code development and debugging\n- Full chip simulation for an accurate model of CPU, interrupts, peripherals, and external stimuli\n\nImportant Notes:\n  - microchip-studio needs a reboot to finish automatically the installation. After the restart, you will be prompted to install 2 certificates from:\n    - Microchip Technology, Inc.\n    - Atmel Corporation.\n  - microchip-studio shortcut icon will appear on the desktop after about 5/10 minutes after the restart.\n  - If you are upgrading from atmel-studio to microchip-studio, you may need to delete the following directories for each users was using atmel-studio:\n    - `$env:appdata\\Atmel\n    - `$env:localappdata\\Atmel\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/microchip-studio/screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-22T23:18:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/microchip-studio/7.0.2594", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/microchip-studio/7.0.2594", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "microchip-studio", "displayName": "Microchip Studio", "summary": "Studio 7 is the integrated development platform (IDP) for developing and debugging all AVR\u00ae and SAM microcontroller applications. The Microchip Studio 7 IDP gives you a seamless and easy-to-use environment to write, build and debug your applications written in C/C++ or assembly code. It also connects seamlessly to the debuggers, programmers and development kits that support AVR\u00ae and SAM devices. Additionally, Studio includes Gallery, an online app store that allows you to extend your development environment with plug-ins developed by Microchip as well as third-party tool and embedded software vendors. Studio 7 can also seamlessly import your Arduino sketches as C++ projects, providing a simple transition path from Makerspace to Marketplace.", "version": "7.0.2594", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/microchip-studio/microchip-studio.png", "author": "Microchip Technology Inc.", "downloadCount": 309, "tags": ["microchip-studio", "integrated", "development", "platform", "idp", "AVR", "SAM", "microchip"]}
