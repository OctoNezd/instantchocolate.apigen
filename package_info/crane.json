{"description": "We hate writing build scripts and continuous integration (ci) templates every time we start a new project or when we work on a project that does not have them. I'm sure you do as well. This is where crane comes in. Invoke crane and it can build you a blank project, complete with a build or you can get crane to assemble you a build on an existing project.
