{"description": "SSLyze\n======\n\nSSLyze is a fast and powerful SSL/TLS scanning library.\n\nIt allows you to analyze the SSL/TLS configuration of a server by connecting to it, in order to detect various\nissues (bad certificate, weak cipher suites, Heartbleed, ROBOT, TLS 1.3 support, etc.).\n\nSSLyze can either be used as a command line tool or as a Python library.\n\nKey features\n------------\n\n* Fully [documented Python API](https://nabla-c0d3.github.io/sslyze/documentation/), in order to run scans and process \nthe results directly from Python.\n* Support for TLS 1.3 and early data (0-RTT) testing.\n* Scans are automatically dispatched among multiple workers, making them very fast.\n* Performance testing: session resumption and TLS tickets support.\n* Security testing: weak cipher suites, supported curves, ROBOT, Heartbleed and more.\n* Server certificate validation and revocation checking through OCSP stapling.\n* Support for StartTLS handshakes on SMTP, XMPP, LDAP, POP, IMAP, RDP, PostGres and FTP.\n* Scan results can be written to a JSON file for further processing.\n* And much more!\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 Alban Diquet\n\nSSLyze is made available under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL).
