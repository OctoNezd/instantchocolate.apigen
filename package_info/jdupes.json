{"description": "jdupes is a program for identifying and taking actions upon duplicate\nfiles. This fork known as 'jdupes' is heavily modified from and improved\nover the original. See CHANGES for details.\n\nA WORD OF WARNING: jdupes IS NOT a drop-in compatible replacement for\nfdupes! Do not blindly replace fdupes with jdupes in scripts and expect\neverything to work the same way. Option availability and meanings differ\nbetween the two programs. For example, the -I switch in jdupes means\n\"isolate\" and blocks intra-argument matching, while in fdupes it means\n\"immediately delete files during scanning without prompting the user.\"", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:48:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/jdupes/1.20.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/jdupes/1.20.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/jbruchon/jdupes/blob/v1.20.2/LICENSE", "packageName": "jdupes", "displayName": "jdupes", "summary": "A powerful duplicate file finder and an enhanced fork of 'fdupes'.", "version": "1.20.2", "icon": "", "author": "Jody Bruchon", "downloadCount": 4077, "tags": ["fdupes", "dupes", "dedupe", "find", "cli", "foss", "cross-platform"]}
