{"description": "tabspace is a small command line tool that converts tabs to spaces or spaces to tabs automatically in files. It also removes spaces at the end of lines.\n\nIt works with ANSI, UTF-8 and even UTF-16 (on Windows mostly referred to as Unicode) files alike.\n\nThe conversion is done so that the alignment always stays the same - the conversion does not simply replace the characters, but uses an algorithm to find out how the replacement has to be done.\n\n[Source code](https://code.google.com/p/stexbar/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FMisc%2Ftabspace)", "updated": "2024-03-20T02:48:34Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/tabspace/1.1.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/tabspace/1.1.2", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "packageName": "tabspace", "displayName": "TabSpace", "summary": "Command line tool to convert tabs to spaces or spaces to tabs automatically in files", "version": "1.1.2", "icon": "", "author": "Stefan Kueng", "downloadCount": 1053, "tags": ["cli", "file", "editing"]}
