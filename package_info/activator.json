Activator is a hub for developers wanting to build Reactive applications. Unlike previous developer-focused offerings that are delivered simply via a website, Activator breaks new ground by delivering a rich application directly to the desktop. Activator updates in real-time with new content from Typesafe and value-add third parties, helping developers engage and adopt Typesafe technologies in an entirely frictionless manner.", "updated": "2024-03-23T06:33:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/activator/1.2.12", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/activator/1.2.12", "licenseUrl": "https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0", "packageName": "activator", "displayName": "activator", "summary": "Typesafe Activator gets you started with the Typesafe Reactive Platform, Play Framework, Akka and Scala", "version": "1.2.12", "icon": "https://www.playframework.com/assets/images/logos/play_icon_full_color.png", "author": "Typesafe", "downloadCount": 2414, "tags": ["activator", "play", "scala", "akka", "java"]}
