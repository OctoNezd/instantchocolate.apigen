{"description": "Notesnook is a free (as in speech) and open source note taking app focused on user privacy and ease of use. To ensure zero knowledge principles, Notesnook encrypts everything on your device using `XChaCha20-Poly1305` and `Argon2`.\n\nNotesnook is our **proof** that privacy does _not_ (always) have to come at the cost of convenience. Our goal is to provide users peace of mind and 100% confidence that their notes are safe and secure. The decision to go fully open source is one of the most crucial steps towards that.\n\n**32 bit users**: This package is not available for 32 bit users.\n\n**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-23T20:18:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/notesnook/2.6.16", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/notesnook/2.6.16", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/streetwriters/notesnook/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "notesnook", "displayName": "Notesnook", "summary": "A fully open source and end-to-end encrypted note taking alternative to Evernote.", "version": "2.6.16", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/streetwriters/notesnook@master/apps/web/desktop/assets/icons/256x256.png", "author": "Streetwriters Ltd.", "downloadCount": 4728, "tags": ["notesnook", "notes", "evernote", "encrypted"]}
