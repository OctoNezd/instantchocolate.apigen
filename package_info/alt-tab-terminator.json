{"description": "Alt-Tab Terminator is an elegant and powerful task management utility for Windows 7/8/10. Once installed, it replaces the default Alt-Tab dialog with a nice box that shows a list of all running tasks, with their names and preview snapshots, and enables the user to take actions on them using the mouse and keyboard shortcuts.\n\nAn average PC-user switches between windows with Alt+Tab hundreds of times per day! It\u2019s one of the most common actions performed on a computer. With Alt-Tab Terminator, you can not only switch tasks faster, but have the full control over any opened window, all within one click away.\n\n**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package.
