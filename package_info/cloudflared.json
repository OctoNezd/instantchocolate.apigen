{"description": "You can connect applications, servers, and other resources to Cloudflare's network using Cloudflare Tunnel. When connected, Cloudflare can apply Zero Trust policies to determine who can reach the resource.\n\nWhen Cloudflare receives a request for your chosen hostname, it proxies the request through those connections to cloudflared. In turn, cloudflared proxies the request to your applications.\n\nThis package is particularly suited to installing the CLI executable for use tunnelling to infrastructure using [Cloudflare Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/teams/access/) as it contains only the standalone binary, and does not configure or create services.\n\nPlease see [Useful commands](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-commands) for usage examples.", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:03:53Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/cloudflared/2024.2.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/cloudflared/2024.2.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "cloudflared", "displayName": "cloudflared", "summary": "The command-line client for Argo Tunnel, a tunneling daemon that proxies any local webserver through the Cloudflare network.", "version": "2024.2.1", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/jpruskin/ChocolateyPackages/master/icons/cloudflared.svg", "author": "Cloudflare", "downloadCount": 15362, "tags": ["cloudflared", "cloudflare", "argo", "tunnel"]}
