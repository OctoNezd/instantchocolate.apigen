{"description": "Serf is a tool for cluster membership, failure detection, and orchestration that is decentralized, fault-tolerant and highly available. Serf runs on every major platform: Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. It is extremely lightweight: it uses 5 to 10 MB of resident memory and primarily communicates using infrequent UDP messages.\n\nSerf uses an efficient gossip protocol to solve three major problems:\n\nMembership: Serf maintains cluster membership lists and is able to execute custom handler scripts when that membership changes. For example, Serf can maintain the list of web servers for a load balancer and notify that load balancer whenever a node comes online or goes offline.\n\nFailure detection and recovery: Serf automatically detects failed nodes within seconds, notifies the rest of the cluster, and executes handler scripts allowing you to handle these events. Serf will attempt to recover failed nodes by reconnecting to them periodically.\n\nCustom event propagation: Serf can broadcast custom events and queries to the cluster. These can be used to trigger deploys, propagate configuration, etc. Events are simply fire-and-forget broadcast, and Serf makes a best effort to deliver messages in the face of offline nodes or network partitions. Queries provide a simple realtime request/response mechanism.", "updated": "2024-03-16T21:33:49Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/serf/0.8.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/serf/0.8.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/hashicorp/serf/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "serf", "displayName": "serf (Install)", "summary": "Serf is a tool for cluster membership, failure detection, and orchestration that is decentralized, fault-tolerant and highly available.
