{"description": "This is the Microsoft C++ UWP framework packages.\n    Windows desktop applications that have a dependency on the C++ Runtime libraries must specify the corresponding version of the C++ Runtime framework package for Desktop Bridge during creation of the application package. This must be done instead of just redistributing the C++ Runtime libraries that are included with Visual Studio or the Visual C++ Runtime redistributable (VCRedist). Windows desktop applications that run in a Desktop Bridge container cannot use the C++ Runtime libraries that are included with Visual Studio or VCRedist. An application that's running in a Desktop Bridge container and that uses an incorrect version of the C++ runtime libraries might fail when it tries to access resources such as the file system or the registry. This article discusses how to create a Desktop Bridge container that includes the correct C++ Runtime libraries.\n\n    **NOTE**: This is a manually updated package.", "updated": "2024-03-23T04:48:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/microsoft-vclibs/14.0.30704.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/microsoft-vclibs/14.0.30704.0", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "microsoft-vclibs", "displayName": "Microsoft.VCLibs (Install)", "summary": "This is the Microsoft C++ UWP framework packages.", "version": "14.0.30704.0", "icon": "", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 26887, "tags": ["microsoft-vclibs", "vclibs", "uwp"]}
