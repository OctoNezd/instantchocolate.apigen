{"description": "The New Relic Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment.\n\nThis is an integration for MSSQL which plugs into the New Relic Infrastructure Agent. As such, it depends on `newrelic-infra`. The Infrastucture agent will need to be properly configured with your license key to work.\n\nOnce installed, a YAML file is required to configure the integration. Please read the documentation [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/microsoft-sql-server-monitoring-integration#config) for details.\n\nPlease note that using this application requires an active subscription with New Relic.\n\nFor more information please visit the [New Relic website](https://newrelic.com) or view the [Microsoft SQL Server Monitoring Integration documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/microsoft-sql-server-monitoring-integration).", "updated": "2024-03-21T13:33:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/newrelic-mssql/2.9.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/newrelic-mssql/2.9.0", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "newrelic-mssql", "displayName": "New Relic MSSQL Integration", "summary": "New Relic MSSQL Integration", "version": "2.9.0", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/dave-pollock/chocolatey-packages/18bcc90ff6e71cc1b64b0d8039f532b44768433b/newrelic-mssql/icon.png", "author": "NewRelic", "downloadCount": 1991, "tags": ["newrelic", "sql", "mssql", "monitoring"]}
