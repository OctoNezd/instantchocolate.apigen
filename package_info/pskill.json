{"description": "Terminate local or remote processes.\n\nWindows NT/2000 does not come with a command-line 'kill' utility. You can get one in the Windows NT or Win2K Resource Kit, but the kit's utility can only terminate processes on the local computer. PsKill is a kill utility that not only does what the Resource Kit's version does, but can also kill processes on remote systems. You don't even have to install a client on the target computer to use PsKill to terminate a remote process.", "updated": "2024-03-22T22:48:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pskill/1.16", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/pskill/1.16", "licenseUrl": "https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb469936", "packageName": "pskill", "displayName": "PsKill", "summary": "Terminate local or remote processes", "version": "1.16", "icon": "", "author": "Mark Russinovich", "downloadCount": 3082, "tags": ["process", "kill", "tools", "sysinternals"]}
