{"description": "SpiderOak provides an easy, secure and consolidated free online backup, storage, access, sharing and sync tool for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora).\nSpiderOak offers a different approach to online backup, synchronization, and sharing.\nThis difference is not just measured in our zero-knowledge privacy policy - the first one ever employed in this setting - but also in our flexible design in handling data from all platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux) and locations (external drives, network volumes, USB keys) in one centralized account.\nA Sync may exist between any two or more folders including two folders that exist as part of the same machine (e.g. between a desktop and an external hard-drive).\nAny items placed inside Hive will automatically upload and then sync to all your other devices (thus effectively replicating the Dropbox folder).", "updated": "2024-03-16T16:03:36Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/spideroak/5.1.8.20140925", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/spideroak/5.1.8.20140925", "licenseUrl": "https://spideroak.com/terms_of_use", "packageName": "spideroak", "displayName": "SpiderOak", "summary": "SpiderOak provides an easy, secure and consolidated free online backup, storage, access, sharing and sync tool for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.", "version": "5.1.8.20140925", "icon": "https://raw.github.com/tonigellida/chocolateyautomaticpackages/master/spideroak/spideroak.png", "author": "SpiderOak", "downloadCount": 2725, "tags": ["notSilent", "notUninstallable", "backup", "online-storage", "online-backup", "folder-sync", "selective-sync"]}
