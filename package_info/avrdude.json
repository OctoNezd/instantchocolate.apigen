{"description": "[AVRDUDE](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/avrdude) is a utility to download/upload/manipulate the ROM and EEPROM contents of AVR microcontrollers using the in-system programming technique (ISP).\n\n## Main features\nThe major features of AVRDUDE include:\n\n- Command-line driven user interface for all downloading and uploading features (including handling fuse bytes), for easy automation e. g. by inclusion into Makefiles.\n- Interactive examination and modification of various memory regions in so-called *terminal mode*. Also offered is an option to modify the operational parameters of an Atmel STK500 board (target voltage, VAref, master clock frequency).\n- Known to run on all major POSIX-style operating systems, as well as Win32 platforms. By using existing operating system drivers on the POSIX-style systems, secure parallel-port access without root privileges can be maintained. On Win32 platforms, parallel port access requires the previous installation of a driver (`giveio.sys`) that grants a user process direct access to the IO registers.\n- Supports a wide range of programming hardware, from cheap ISP plugs that connect the AVR's ISP interface directly to a computer's parallel port (no additional circuitry) or serial port (some additional circuitry needed), more advanced ISP adapters using a buffer/driver chip (like a 74HC373), up to (more complex) serially connected programmers like AVR910-style ISP devices, the Atmel STK500 board, and the Atmel JTAG ICE mkII. Most popular adapters come pre-defined, adding a new parallel-port adapter is as simple as editing a configuration file (no recompilation needed).\n- Supports Intel Hex, Motorola S-Record, and raw binary files for input and output, as well as direct memory contents specification on the command-line (useful e. g. for fuse bytes). On input, the file format can be auto-detected.\n- In \"terminal mode\", the device's memory areas can be examined, and possibly modified. This allows to set fuses interactively, or to modify a few EEPROM cells.", "updated": "2024-03-23T16:33:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/avrdude/6.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/avrdude/6.3", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt", "packageName": "avrdude", "displayName": "AVR Downloader/UploaDEr", "summary": "AVRDUDE is a utility to download/upload/manipulate the ROM and EEPROM contents of AVR microcontrollers using the in-system programming technique (ISP).", "version": "6.3", "icon": "", "author": "AVR Downloader/UploaDEr Team.", "downloadCount": 1274, "tags": ["avrdude", "ROM", "EEPROM", "AVR", "microcontrollers", "download", "upload", "manipulate"]}
