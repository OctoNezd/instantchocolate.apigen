{"description": "# **Chocolatey Fast Answers Extension** is a Chocolatey extension for use as a dependency by package maintainers.\n\n# PURPOSE:\nTo provide (fairly) easy to remember micro functions for (new?) package creators/maintainers to get short fast answers to common decision tree questions that come up during package creation. The majority of functions return True/False. None of the functions are complex and most rely on WMI. By using this Chocolatey extension you can easily script situations such as aborting an install for a package/program that doesn't work on servers by checking first using Get-IsWinServer or conversely Get-IsWinWorkstation. Maybe you have a package that needs to make sure there is not a pending reboot and you can check using Get-PendingReboot and error out with a message explaining to reboot and try again. Maybe you have a package that only runs on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016, you can easy check at the beginning of your script using Get-IsWin10 or Get-IsWinServer2016. \n\n...and yes, nobody will probably use Get-IsSSD except me for some non-Chocolatey scripts! :) \n(Though IMHO defrag packages should abort if a SSD is found and warn that it's not recommended to defrag a SSD.)\n\nThe use cases go on...\n\n# FUNCTIONS:\n![List of functions](https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/chocolatey-fastanswers.extension_extras/List_of_functions.png)\n\nScreenshot testing all functions with simple test-package install script that does: $test=function and Write-Out function result for each function. Results from the functions show that the test package was run on a computer with Microsoft Windows 10 Pro build 16299 64bit, joined to a domain, (onboard) Intel video, (discreet) Nvidia video, has a SSD, is a workstation not a server, and is pending a reboot.\n![](https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/chocolatey-fastanswers.extension_extras/chocolatey-fastanswers.extension.png)\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/chocolatey-fastanswers.extension_extras/readme.md)**", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey-fastanswers.extension/0.0.2.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/chocolatey-fastanswers.extension/0.0.2.2", "licenseUrl": "https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Public_domain", "packageName": "chocolatey-fastanswers.extension", "displayName": "Chocolatey Fast Answers Extension", "summary": "Chocolatey Fast Answers Extension is a (fairly) easy to remember collection of micro functions for package creators/maintainers.", "version": "0.0.2.2", "icon": "https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/mylogos/myunofficialChocolateylogo_icon.png", "author": "Bill Curran", "downloadCount": 424382, "tags": ["bcurran3", "choco", "fast", "answers", "extension", "extensions"]}
