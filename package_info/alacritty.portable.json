{"description": "![Alacritty - A fast, cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alacritty/alacritty/v0.13/extra/promo/alacritty-readme.png)\n\n## About\n\nAlacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but\nallows for extensive [configuration](#configuration). By integrating with other\napplications, rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to\nprovide a flexible set of [features](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/tree/v0.13.1/docs/features.md) with high performance.\nThe supported platforms currently consist of BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.\n\nThe software is considered to be at a **beta** level of readiness; there are\na few missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as\na daily driver.\n\nPrecompiled binaries are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).\n\nJoin [`#alacritty`] on libera.chat if you have questions or looking for a quick help.\n\n[`#alacritty`]: https://web.libera.chat/gamja/?channels=#alacritty\n\n## Features\n\nYou can find an overview over the features available in Alacritty [here](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/tree/v0.13.1/docs/features.md).\n\n## Further information\n\n- [Announcing Alacritty, a GPU-Accelerated Terminal Emulator](https://jwilm.io/blog/announcing-alacritty/) January 6, 2017\n- [A talk about Alacritty at the Rust Meetup January 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHOdYO3WUTk) January 19, 2017\n- [Alacritty Lands Scrollback, Publishes Benchmarks](https://jwilm.io/blog/alacritty-lands-scrollback/) September 17, 2018\n\n### Requirements\n\n- At least OpenGL ES 2.0\n- [Windows] ConPTY support (Windows 10 version 1809 or higher)\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can find the documentation for Alacritty's configuration in `man 5\nalacritty`, or by looking at [the website] if you do not have the manpages\ninstalled.\n\n[the website]: https://alacritty.org/config-alacritty.html\n\nAlacritty doesn't create the config file for you, but it looks for one in the\nfollowing locations:\n\n1. `$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`\n2. `$HOME/.alacritty.toml`\n\nOn Windows, the config file should be located at:\n\n`%APPDATA%\\alacritty\\alacritty.toml`\n\n## Contributing\n\nA guideline about contributing to Alacritty can be found in the\n[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/tree/v0.13.1/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**_Is it really the fastest terminal emulator?_**\n\nBenchmarking terminal emulators is complicated. Alacritty uses\n[vtebench](https://github.com/alacritty/vtebench) to quantify terminal emulator\nthroughput and manages to consistently score better than the competition using\nit. If you have found an example where this is not the case, please report a\nbug.\n\nOther aspects like latency or framerate and frame consistency are more difficult\nto quantify. Some terminal emulators also intentionally slow down to save\nresources, which might be preferred by some users.\n\nIf you have doubts about Alacritty's performance or usability, the best way to\nquantify terminal emulators is always to test them with **your** specific\nusecases.\n\n**_Why isn't feature X implemented?_**\n\nAlacritty has many great features, but not every feature from every other\nterminal. This could be for a number of reasons, but sometimes it's just not a\ngood fit for Alacritty. This means you won't find things like tabs or splits\n(which are best left to a window manager or [terminal multiplexer][tmux]) nor\nniceties like a GUI config editor.\n\n[tmux]: https://github.com/tmux/tmux\n\n## License\n\nAlacritty is released under the [Apache License, Version 2.0].\n\n[Apache License, Version 2.0]: https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/tree/v0.13.1/LICENSE-APACHE", "updated": "2024-03-20T11:48:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/alacritty.portable/0.13.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/alacritty.portable/0.13.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/v0.13.1/LICENSE-APACHE", "packageName": "alacritty.portable", "displayName": "Alacritty (Portable)", "summary": "A fast, cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator", "version": "0.13.1", "icon": "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Starz0r/13dfbf8b1373144289617461e805c5cb/raw/3d093e40f84ce168008056e56a3d1624b676d4e6/alacritty.png", "author": "Joe Wilm", "downloadCount": 7292, "tags": ["foss", "development", "cli", "shell", "bash", "powershell", "cmd", "posix", "unix", "linux", "gnu", "cygwin", "msys", "msys2", "mingw", "graphical", "console", "emulator", "hardware", "gpu", "terminal", "admin"]}
