{"description": "## Features that set us apart\n* Support of the latest version of OTR.\n* Detection of Tor (if installed) and connection through it.\n* Use of Tor Onion Service if it is known by the server in question.\n* Use of separate Tor circuits for each account in order to make it harder to tie accounts together.\n* Insertion of random delays before connecting to each account in order to make fingerprinting of connections between accounts harder.\n* SRV lookup for the server over Tor if available.\n* Import of account settings, OTR settings, fingerprints, and private keys from other clients like Pidgin, Adium, Gajim or xmpp-client.\n* Saving of all your configuration, including OTR fingerprints and keys, in an encrypted configuration file.\n\n## Notes\nRun tor via powershell before start coyim. Otherwise display a warning window that \"We could not find a running installation of Tor.\n\nThis package install in user profile's folder(C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\coyim) instead of allusers(administrator) folder(C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\lib\\coyim\\tools), since coyim portable cannot run in this folder.\n\ncoyim in user profile's folder will not get uninstalled automatically by this package.
