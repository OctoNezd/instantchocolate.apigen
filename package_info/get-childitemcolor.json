{"description": "Get-ChildItemColor provides colored version of Get-ChildItem Cmdlet and Get-ChildItem | Format-Wide (ls equivalent).\n\n* This adds colors to the output of Get-ChildItem Cmdlet of PowerShell. It is based on Tim Johnson\u2019s script and another script by the PowerShell Guy.\n* Before version 1.0.0, the script actually had used Write-Host to write colored items on console. Now it just changes $Host.UI.RawUI.ForegroundColor and keep the item object intact. Hence, now one can use pipeline. (e.g., ~Get-ChildItemColor | grep \u201c.git\u201d~).\n* Get-ChildItemColorFormatWide still uses Write-Host for output however. This is because Get-ChildItemColor | Format-Wide does not allow multiple colors in one line. Hence, pipeline does not work with Get-ChildItemColorFormatWide.\n\n**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-20T13:18:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/get-childitemcolor/3.4.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/get-childitemcolor/3.4.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/joonro/Get-ChildItemColor/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "get-childitemcolor", "displayName": "Get-ChildItemColor (PowerShell Module)", "summary": "Get-ChildItemColor provides colored version of Get-ChildItem Cmdlet and Get-ChildItem | Format-Wide (ls equivalent).", "version": "3.4.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pauby/ChocoPackages@d1f23852/icons/get-childitemcolor.png", "author": "Joon Ro", "downloadCount": 4909, "tags": ["admin", "powershell", "module", "template", "get-childitemcolor"]}
