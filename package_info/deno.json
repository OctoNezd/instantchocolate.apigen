{"description": "Deno aims to be a productive and secure scripting environment for the modern programmer.\n\nDeno will always be distributed as a single executable. Given a URL to a Deno program, it is runnable with nothing more than the 10 megabyte zipped executable. Deno explicitly takes on the role of both runtime and package manager. It uses a standard browser-compatible protocol for loading modules: URLs.\n      \nDeno provides security guarantees about how programs can access your system with the default being the most restrictive secure sandbox.\n      \nDeno provides a set of reviewed (audited) standard modules that are guaranteed to work with Deno.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/deno/1.41.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/deno/1.41.3", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/master/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "deno", "displayName": "Deno", "summary": "A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript built with V8, Rust, and Tokio.", "version": "1.41.3", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/denoland/deno_website2/714f954418e1b26ca59c1d4c02135341c19a35e1/public/images/deno_logo_3.svg", "author": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/contributors", "downloadCount": 137919, "tags": ["v8", "deno", "denoland", "deno_install", "javascript", "typescript", "rust", "tokio", "runtime"]}
