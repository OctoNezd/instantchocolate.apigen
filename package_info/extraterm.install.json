{"description": "## Features\nExtraterm is a open source terminal emulator which aims to add many new features to bring the traditional terminal into the modern era.\n\nIt is currently in steady development and although not at a 1.0 release yet, it is generally stable for everyday use provided you can tolerate the occasional bug. (Submit bug reports here .)\n\n### Tiling and panes\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/extraterm.install/screenshot1.png)\n\n### Command Palette\nExtraterm is designed for keyboard use first.

This enables new fast `ad hoc` workflows.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/extraterm.install/screenshot5.gif)\n\nOr you can edit the command output directly in place and execute the selection with Ctrl+Shift+Enter.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/extraterm.install/screenshot6.gif)\n\n### Easy Downloads and Uploads\nThe shell integration makes uploading and downloading files easy without requiring additional tools. It works transparently across SSH too.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chtof/chocolatey-packages/automatic/extraterm.install/screenshot7.png)", "updated": "2024-03-21T17:33:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/extraterm.install/0.76.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/extraterm.install/0.76.0", "licenseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sedwards2009/extraterm/v0.42.2/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "extraterm.install", "displayName": "Extraterm (Install)", "summary": "The swiss army chainsaw of terminal emulators", "version": "0.76.0", "icon": "", "author": "Simon Edwards", "downloadCount": 6209, "tags": ["extraterm.install", "terminal", "emulator"]}
