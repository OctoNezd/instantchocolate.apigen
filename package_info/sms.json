{"description": "# SMS 13.0 - The Complete Surface-water Solution\n\n## Flexible modeling approaches\n\nAquaveo pioneered the conceptual model approach. Build a conceptual model in SMS by constructing a high level representation of the model using familiar GIS objects: points, arcs and polygons. Work with large, complex models in a simple and efficient manner by using the conceptual modeling approach and easily update or change the model as needed.\n\n\nSMS also has powerful tools to build meshes and grids.\n\n---\n## 3D visualization optimized for performance\n\nSMS is the most advanced software system available for performing surface-water simulations in a three-dimensional environment.\n\n\n* Interact with models in true 3D\n* Optimized OpenGL graphics for improved hardware rendering\n* Create photo-realistic renderings\n* Generate animations for PowerPoint or web presentations\n* Drape images over the model and control the opacity\n* Annotations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Add north arrows, scale bars, reference images, company logos, and more\n\n---\n## Import a variety of data formats & imagery\n\nModels require data from many different sources. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why SMS is built to easily import numerous file types:\n\n* Raster images including georeference and projection support\n* Topographical maps & elevation data\n* Borehole data including stratigraphy and geophysical data\n* Native MODFLOW files\n* MODFLOW files from Visual MODFLOW, Groundwater Vistas and PM Win\n* Web data services such as TerraServer\n* ArcGIS geodatabases and shapefiles\n* CAD files including .dwg, .dgn, and .dxf formats\n* Worldwide projection support including Cartesian and Geographic Systems\n* File Import wizard for delimited text files and spreadsheets\n\n---\n## Advanced subsurface characterization\n\nFrom cross-section editing to advanced probability statistics, GMS offers unparalleled subsurface modeling tools.\n\n* Generate iso-surfaces from 3D data to visualize plumes\n* Cut cross-sections anywhere through 3D data\n* 2D & 3D geostatistics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Kriging, IDW and Natural Neighbor\n* Robust and fast algorithms to create solids from horizons\n\n---\n## Software from an Industry Leader\n\nSMS is developed by Aquaveo, an engineering services company with many years of experience developing groundwater modeling solutions.\n\n* Step-by-step tutorials and how-to videos\n* Online community forum and product documentation\n* Phone and email technical support\n* Regularly scheduled training courses taught by expert modelers\n* On-site training available\n* Professional consulting services", "updated": "2024-03-22T05:33:36Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sms/13.1.15", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/sms/13.1.15", "licenseUrl": "http://aquaveo.com/end-user-license-agreement", "packageName": "sms", "displayName": "Surface-water Modeling System (SMS) Software", "summary": "Access a full range of coastal and riverine solutions with SMS - the leading application for surface-water modeling", "version": "13.1.15", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kylebaker/AquaveoChocolateyPackages@master/icons/sms-icon.png", "author": "Aquaveo", "downloadCount": 2466, "tags": ["sms", "aquaveo", "trial"]}
