{"description": "ColorTool is a utility for helping to set the color palette of the Windows Console. By default, applies the colors in the specified .itermcolors or .ini file to the current console window. This does NOT save the properties automatically. For that, you'll need to open the properties sheet and hit \"Ok\". Included should be a `schemes/` directory with a selection of schemes of both formats for examples. Feel free to add your own preferred scheme to that directory.", "updated": "2024-03-23T23:33:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/colortool/19.04.29002", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/colortool/19.04.29002", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/Microsoft/console/blob/master/tools/ColorTool/LICENSE", "packageName": "colortool", "displayName": "Windows Console Color Tool", "summary": "A tool to make it easier to change the console to your desired scheme.", "version": "19.04.29002", "icon": "", "author": "Windows Console Team", "downloadCount": 6971, "tags": ["windows", "console", "color"]}
