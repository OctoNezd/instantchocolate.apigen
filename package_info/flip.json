{"description": "# flip\nThe program converts line endings of text files between MS-DOS and UNIX formats. It detects binary files in a nearly foolproof way and leaves them alone unless you override this. It will also leave files alone that are already in the right format and preserves file timestamps. User interrupts are handled gracefully and no garbage or corrupted files left behind.\n\nThe program does not convert files to a different character set, and it can not handle old Apple Macintosh line endings that use CR only.\n\n\n## Usage\n```\n$ flip -h\nFile interchange program flip version 1.19.
