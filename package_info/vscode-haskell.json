{"description": "This extension adds language support for [Haskell](https://haskell.org/), powered by the [Haskell Language Server](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server).\n\n## Features\n\n* Warning and error diagnostics from [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/)\n* Type information and documentation on hover\n* Jump to definition\n* Document symbols\n* Highlight references in document\n* Code completion\n* Formatting via [Brittany](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brittany), [Floskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/floskell), [Ormolu](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ormolu) or [Stylish Haskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stylish-haskell)\n* [Multi-root workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces) support\n* Code evaluation ([Haskell Language Server](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server#haskell-language-server))\n\n## Package Requirements\n\n* For standalone .hs/.lhs files, [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) must be installed and on the PATH. The easiest way to install it is with the [GHC package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ghc)\n* The extension will download an appropriate `haskell-language-server` provided the ghc version is supported.  On Windows currently supported GHC versions are 8.6.4, 8.6.5 and 8.10.1 - `choco install ghc --version=8.6.4`, `choco install ghc --version=8.6.5` or `choco install ghc --version=8.10.1`\n* For Cabal based projects, both GHC and [cabal-install](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) must be installed and on the PATH. It can be installed\nwith the [Cabal package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/cabal) - `choco install cabal`\n* For Stack based projects, [stack](http://haskellstack.org/) must be installed and on the PATH.  Stack can be installed with the\n[haskell-stack package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/haskell-stack) - `choco install haskell-stack`\n\n## Notes\n\n* This package requires Visual Studio Code 1.82.0 or newer.\n  You can install either the [vscode](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vscode) or [vscode-insiders](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vscode-insiders) package.\n* The extension will be installed in all editions of Visual Studio Code which can be found.\n* While this package installs a specific version of the extension, Visual Studio Code by default will update the extension to the latest version on startup if there's a newer version available on the marketplace.\n  See [Extension auto-update](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_extension-autoupdate) for instructions on how to disable auto-update.\n* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).\n  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.f you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-21T11:03:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vscode-haskell/2.5.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vscode-haskell/2.5.2", "licenseUrl": "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/haskell.haskell/license", "packageName": "vscode-haskell", "displayName": "Haskell VSCode Extension", "summary": "Haskell language support powered by the Haskell Language Server, ghcide or HIE", "version": "2.5.2", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@1fe0edcd52fc2a606d586b5ba2dd0fd9d5f6eb93/icons/vscode-haskell.png", "author": "Haskell Team", "downloadCount": 2837, "tags": ["haskell", "cabal", "stack", "hls", "vscode", "haskell.org"]}
