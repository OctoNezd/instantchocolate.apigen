{"description": "Gephi is an interactive visualization and exploration platform for all kinds of networks and complex systems, dynamic\nand hierarchical graphs.\n\nGephi is a tool for people that have to explore and understand graphs. Like Photoshop but for graphs, the user interacts\nwith the representation, manipulate the structures, shapes and colors to reveal hidden properties. The goal is to help\ndata analysts to make hypothesis, intuitively discover patterns, isolate structure singularities or faults during data\nsourcing. It is a complementary tool to traditional statistics, as visual thinking with interactive interfaces is now\nrecognized to facilitate reasoning. This is software for [Exploratory Data Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis),\na paradigm appeared in the [Visual Analytics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Analytics) field of research.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@368ae85553c5491c9c6867b0e1b3f02336389777/automatic/gephi/screenshot.png)\n\n## Features\n\n* **Fast** Powered by a built-in OpenGL engine, Gephi is able to push the envelope with very large networks. Visualize\nnetworks up to a million elements. All actions (e.g. layout, filter, drag) run in real-time.\n* **Simple** Easy to install and [get started](https://gephi.github.io/users/quick-start). A UI that is centered around\nthe visualization. Like Photoshop\u2122 for graphs.\n* **Modular** Extend Gephi with [plug-ins](https://gephi.org/plugins). The architecture is built on top of the Netbeans\nPlatform and can be extended or reused easily through well-written APIs.\n\n## Package Parameters\n\nIf any package parameters are supplied no defaults will be used - only supplied parameters will be applied. The\nfollowing package parameter can be set:\n\n* `/InstallDir`       - install Gephi to the specified folder.\n* `/AddToDesktop`     - add a desktop shortcut\n* `/AddToQuickLaunch` - add a quick launch shortcut\n* `/AssociateGephi`   - add file association for Gephi Project files (.gephi)\n* `/AssociateGexf`    - add file association for Graph Exchange XML Format files (.gexf)\n* `/AssociateGdf`     - add file association for GUESS format GDF Graph files (.gdf)\n* `/AssociateGraphml` - add file association for GraphML Graph files (.graphml)\n* `/AssociateNet`     - add file association for Pajek NET Graph files (.net)\n* `/CleanUserDir`     - clear user preferences from prior installs\n\neg. `choco install -y gephi --package-parameters=\"/InstallDir=C:\\Tools\\Gephi /AddToDesktop /AssociateGephi\"`\n\nTo have Chocolatey remember parameters on upgrade, be sure to set `choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`.\n\n## Notes\n\n* The installer is a combined installer containing both 32 and 64-bit versions and will always install according to the\n  bitness of the OS.\n* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).\n  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-21T02:03:51Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gephi/0.10.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/gephi/0.10.1", "licenseUrl": "https://gephi.org/developers/license", "packageName": "gephi", "displayName": "Gephi - The Open Graph Viz Platform", "summary": "Gephi is a platform for visualizing and manipulating large graphs", "version": "0.10.1", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@368ae85553c5491c9c6867b0e1b3f02336389777/icons/gephi.png", "author": "Gephi Contributors", "downloadCount": 2783, "tags": ["gephi", "opengl", "graph", "graph-analytics", "visualization"]}
