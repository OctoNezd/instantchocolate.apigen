{"description": "TripleA is a turn based strategy game and board game engine, similar to Axis & Allies or Risk. Though TripleA comes with many games inside, it is just an engine for playing games, and is not a game itself.  TripleA started out as a World War II simulation, but has since expanded to include different conflicts, as well as variations and mods of popular games and maps (a \u2018map\u2019 is like a board, while a \u2018game\u2019 is a specific setup on a map/board).", "updated": "2024-03-05T21:48:51Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/triplea/2.5.22294", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/triplea/2.5.22294", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "triplea", "displayName": "TripleA (Install)", "summary": "The World\u2019s Foremost Open-Source Grand Strategy Game", "version": "2.5.22294", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/triplea-game/assets/ee0b9a84a581ebfc70729a88486ef21b0180c4a5/game_headed_assets/icons/triplea_icon_128_128.png", "author": "TripleA contributors", "downloadCount": 473, "tags": ["game", "strategy", "axis-and-allies", "war"]}
