{"description": "NetWorx is a simple and free, yet powerful tool that helps you objectively evaluate your bandwidth consumption situation. You can use it to collect bandwidth usage data and measure the speed of your Internet or any other network connections. NetWorx can help you identify possible sources of network problems, ensure that you do not exceed the bandwidth limits specified by your ISP, or track down suspicious network activity characteristic of Trojan horses and hacker attacks.\n\nThe program allows you to monitor all your network connections or just a specific network connection, such as Wireless or Mobile Broadband. The software also features an array of highly customisable visual and sound alerts. You can set it up to alert you when the network connection is down or when some suspicious activity \u2014 such as unusually heavy data flow \u2014 occurs. It can also automatically disconnect all dial-up connections and shut the system down.\n\nThe incoming and outgoing traffic is represented on a line chart and logged into a file, so that you can always view statistics about your daily, weekly and monthly bandwidth usage and dial-up duration. The reports can be exported to a variety of formats, such as HTML, MS Word and Excel, for further analysis.", "updated": "2024-03-22T13:33:44Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/networx/6.2.5", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/networx/6.2.5", "licenseUrl": "https://www.softperfect.com/products/networx/manual/license.htm", "packageName": "networx", "displayName": "NetWorx", "summary": "NetWorx is a simple and free, yet powerful tool that helps you objectively evaluate your bandwidth consumption situation.", "version": "6.2.5", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/Sparticuz/ChocoPackages/master/networx/networx.png", "author": "Soft Perfect", "downloadCount": 5464, "tags": ["networx", "admin", "bandwidth", "monitor", "usage", "reporting"]}
