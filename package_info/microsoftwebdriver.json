{"description": "While the Microsoft Edge WebDriver downloads are available in https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/, it's\n    very common to end up using a wrong version. Even more, build after the\n    Windows 10 April 2018 Update will have WebDriver as a capability of the OS\n    instead of a separate download file.\n    This package automatically installs the right version for WebDriver (file or\n    capability) based on your Windows 10 build number.\n\n    `MicrosoftWebDriver.exe` will get added to the following paths:\n    * `%WINDIR%\\System32` if your OS is x86\n    * `%WINDIR%\\SysWOW64` if your OS is x64\n\n    In both cases, it will be in the `PATH` so it can be used anywhere.\n\n    **Only stable versions of Windows 10 are supported prior build 17134.**", "updated": "2024-03-18T16:33:40Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/microsoftwebdriver/1.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/microsoftwebdriver/1.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://az813057.vo.msecnd.net/eulas/webdriver-eula.pdf", "packageName": "microsoftwebdriver", "displayName": "Microsoft WebDriver", "summary": "Install the right WebDriver version for your Windows 10 build", "version": "1.0.0", "icon": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/606594/41067519-c87de6bc-699a-11e8-8824-7028c8ac165d.png", "author": "Microsoft Edge", "downloadCount": 1703, "tags": ["edge", "microsoft", "webdriver", "driver", "web", "microsoftedgewebdriver", "microsoftwebdriver"]}
