{"description": "Git for Windows focuses on offering a lightweight, native set of tools that bring the full feature set of the Git SCM to Windows while providing appropriate user interfaces for experienced Git users and novices alike.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Git BASH**: Git for Windows provides a BASH emulation used to run Git from the command line. *NIX users should feel right at home, as the BASH emulation behaves just like the \"git\" command in LINUX and UNIX environments.\n- **Git GUI**: As Windows users commonly expect graphical user interfaces, Git for Windows also provides the Git GUI, a powerful alternative to Git BASH, offering a graphical version of just about every Git command line function, as well as comprehensive visual diff tools.\n- **Shell Integration**: Simply right-click on a folder in Windows Explorer to access the BASH or GUI.\n\n## Package parameters\n\nSee the [Git Package Parameters documentation page](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages/blob/master/automatic/git.install/ARGUMENTS.md).\n\nExample for passing in package parameters:\n`choco install git.install --params \"'/GitAndUnixToolsOnPath /WindowsTerminal /NoAutoCrlf'\"`\n\n## Notes\n\n- The package uses default install options minus cheetah integration and desktop icons. Cheetah prevents a good upgrade scenario, so it has been removed.\n- **If the package is out of date please check [Version History](#versionhistory) for the latest submitted version. If you have a question, please ask it in [Chocolatey Community Package Discussions](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages/discussions) or raise an issue on the [Chocolatey Community Packages Repository](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages/issues) if you have problems with the package. Disqus comments will generally not be responded to.**", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/git.install/2.44.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/git.install/2.44.0", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "packageName": "git.install", "displayName": "Git (Install)", "summary": "Git for Windows offers a native set of tools that bring the full feature set of the Git SCM to Windows", "version": "2.44.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages@10a8d98b2f320b565fa5349a4352e79666db71ff/icons/git.svg", "author": "The Git Development Community", "downloadCount": 13412577, "tags": ["git", "vcs", "dvcs", "version-control", "msysgit", "admin", "foss", "cross-platform", "cli"]}
