{"description": "This is a command line tool that generates (pretty much) the same unicorn avatar images as the Unicornify web service, just in better quality.\n\nUnicorns are always generated based on a single (hexadecimal) number. Usually, this number is generated from an email address (by taking the MD5 hash, just like Gravatar). For example, the number corresponding to the address mail@example.com is 7daf6c79d4802916d83f6266e24850af.", "updated": "2024-03-19T20:48:55Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/unicornify/0.0.0.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/unicornify/0.0.0.1", "licenseUrl": "https://bitbucket.org/balpha/go-unicornify/src/tip/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "unicornify", "displayName": "Unicornify", "summary": "This is a command line tool that generates (pretty much) the same unicorn avatar images as the Unicornify web service, just in better quality.", "version": "0.0.0.1", "icon": "http://anthonymastrean.github.io/chocolateypackages/icons/unicornify.png", "author": "Benjamin Dumke-von der Ehe", "downloadCount": 1009, "tags": ["unicorn", "png"]}
