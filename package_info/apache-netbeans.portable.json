{"description": "Apache NetBeans is an integrated development environment for Java. NetBeans allows applications\nto be developedfrom a set of software components called modules.\nNetBeans runs on Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux and Solaris.\nIn addition to Java development, it has extensions for other languages like\nPHP, C, C++, HTML5, and Javascript. Applications based on NetBeans, including the NetBeans IDE,\ncan be extended by third party developers. Apache Netbeans is the successor of Oracle Netbeans whose\nproduct line ended with version 8.2. In September 2016, Oracle submitted a proposal to donate\nthe NetBeans project to the Apache Software Foundation, stating that it was \"opening up the\nNetBeans governance model to give NetBeans constituents a greater voice in the project's\ndirection and future success through the upcoming release of Java 9 and NetBeans 9 and beyond\".\nThere is no direct upgrade path between Oracle Netbeans and Apache Netbean hence a new\nchocolatey package had to be created.\n\n**Note**: This package does not depend on a particular jdk since there are so many of them now.\nIn order to use Apache Netbeans it is required to also have one of the following jdks\n(Chocolatey package IDs) installed:\n\n* jdk8, jdk11\n* openjdk.portable\n* openjdk, openjdk11, openjdk12, openjdk13\n* adoptopenjdk, adoptopenjdk8, adoptopenjdk11, adoptopenjdk12, adoptopenjdk13\n* zulu, zulu8, zulu9, zulu10, zulu12, zulu13\n\n**Note**: For non-Oracle JDKs it might be necessary to configure ist location by setting the\n`netbeans_jdkhome` property in file\n`C:/ProgramData/chocolatey/lib/apache-netbeans.portable/App/netbeans/etc/netbeans.conf`\n\nExample: `netbeans_jdkhome=\"C:/Program Files/OpenJDK/jdk-13.0.2\"`", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:18:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/apache-netbeans.portable/21.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/apache-netbeans.portable/21.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans/blob/9.0-vc3/LICENSE", "packageName": "apache-netbeans.portable", "displayName": "Apache Netbeans (Portable)", "summary": "NetBeans is an open source development environment, tooling platform, and application framework.", "version": "21.0.0", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/WetHat/chocolatey-packages/843e59f3/apache-netbeans.portable/ApacheNetBeans444x512.png", "author": "Apache Netbeans Team", "downloadCount": 84625, "tags": ["netbeans.portable", "netbeans", "portable", "Java", "IDE", "JavaScript", "PHP", "HTML5", "CSS", "HTML", "Development"]}
