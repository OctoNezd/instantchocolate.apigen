{"description": "GNU gperf is a perfect hash function generator. For a given list of strings, it produces a hash function and hash table, in form of C or C++ code, for looking up a value depending on the input string. The hash function is perfect, which means that the hash table has no collisions, and the hash table lookup needs a single string comparison only.\n\nGNU gperf is highly customizable. There are options for generating C or C++ code, for emitting switch statements or nested ifs instead of a hash table, and for tuning the algorithm employed by gperf.", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:18:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gperf/3.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/gperf/3.1", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html", "packageName": "gperf", "displayName": "GNU gperf", "summary": "A command-line utility to generate perfect hash functions.", "version": "3.1", "icon": "http://cdn.rawgit.com/carlescufi/chocolatey-packages/d093452c1fc5c9f7c1bd9a0a5667c9c6b0173ac3/icons/gperf.svg", "author": "Douglas C.
