{"description": "XBian is a small, fast and lightweight media center distribution for the Raspberry Pi, CuBox-i, Hummingboard and many more devices to come. It is based on a minimal Debian and therefore offers much of the same freedom as Debian offers.\n\nOur slogan is \u201cXBian, the bleeding edge\u201d as our main focus is delivering the fastest Kodi solution for various small form factor computers.\n\nJust like Debian, XBian incorporates rolling releases. This means that different from other distributions such as OpenELEC or Raspbmc, XBian doesn't release fixed images that often.\n\nIn contrast, XBian offers new package updates at least once a week. This means that new improvements and bugfixes are delivered quickly and easily.\n\nWhen you keep your system updated, you will also start using new releases automatically. When all packages belonging to a new release are installed, XBian will also increase its own version.\n\nSo, you never need to reinstall!\n\nThis also means you can just install XBian Beta 2 and upgrade to XBian Release Candidate 2 in one go. Just as you can upgrade to XBian Stable 1 once it is released.", "updated": "2024-03-19T13:48:40Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/xbian-installer/1.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/xbian-installer/1.4", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/xbianonpi/xbian/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "xbian-installer", "displayName": "XBian Installer", "summary": "XBian is a small, fast and lightweight media center distribution for the Raspberry Pi, CuBox-i, Hummingboard", "version": "1.4", "icon": "http://www.xbian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/xbian_logo.png", "author": "XBian", "downloadCount": 762, "tags": ["xbian", "xbmc", "raspberry", "kodi", "raspberrypi", "raspberry-pi", "pi", "mediacenter", "media", "media-center", "distribution"]}
