{"description": "## gridcoinwallet\nGridcoin is a decentralized, open-source, math-based digital asset (cryptocurrency). Gridcoin, \nwhile energy-efficient, is the first and only cryptocurrency that rewards individuals for scientific \ncontributions and performs transactions peer-to-peer cryptographically - without the need for a \ncentral authority to distribute rewards. It is the first block chain protocol that delivered a \nworking algorithm that rewards and cryptographically proves solving BOINC (Berkeley Open \nInfrastructure for Network Computing) hosted work, which could be virtually any kind of \ncomputing process. Gridcoin provides benefits to humanity through contributions to \ncomputational research. There are no limitations to a single BOINC project, providing the \nflexibility to be rewarded for virtually any type of computational process. \n\tThe wallet and it's config file is stored in `%APPDATA%\\GridcoinResearch`.\n\n### Package-specific issue\nIf this package isn't up-to-date for some days, [Create an issue](https://github.com/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages/issues/new/choose)\n\nSupport the package maintainer and [![Patreon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@d15c4e19c709e7148588d4523ffc6dd3cd3c7e5e/icons/patreon.png)](https://www.patreon.com/tunisiano)", "updated": "2024-03-21T04:03:43Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gridcoinwallet/5.4.7", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/gridcoinwallet/5.4.7", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/gridcoin-community/Gridcoin-Research/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "gridcoinwallet", "displayName": "Gridcoin Wallet", "summary": "Gridcoin is an open source cryptocurrency which securely rewards volunteer computing performed on the BOINC platform.", "version": "5.4.7", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@7cc8d197a0daa3297060d92a75902352d1cce156/icons/gridcoinwallet.png", "author": "Gridcoin Developers", "downloadCount": 3023, "tags": ["gridcoin", "wallet", "grc", "crypto", "cryptocurrency"]}
