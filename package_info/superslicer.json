{"description": "# SuperSlicer\n\n**A PrusaSlicer fork (which is a slic3r fork)** (previously Slic3r++)\n\nPrebuilt Windows, Linux and macOS 64-bit releases are available through the [git releases page](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/releases). The Linux and macOS builds aren't tested (by me), just compiled, so please report any bugs that may occur during use.\nNightly builds are available through the [git actions page](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/actions). Click on the build for your platform and then on 'Artifacts (1)' in the top right corner.\n\nSuperSlicer takes 3D models (STL, OBJ, AMF) and converts them into G-code\ninstructions for FFF printers or PNG layers for mSLA 3D printers. It's compatible with any modern printer based on the RepRap toolchain which is running a firmware based on Marlin, Prusa, Klipper, etc.\n\nSuperSlicer is based on [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer) by Prusa Research.\nPrusaSlicer is based on [Slic3r](https://github.com/Slic3r/Slic3r) by Alessandro Ranellucci and the RepRap community.\n\nSee the [wiki](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/wiki) and\nthe [documentation directory](doc/) for information about compilation.\n\n### What are SuperSlicer main features? main new features/differences?\n\n* Custom-made generated calibration tests.\n* **Ironing** top surface and many new settings to fine-tune the top surface quality, like 'only one perimeter on top'.\n* A \"denser infill\" option for supporting the (solid) top layers.\n* Better **Thin walls** (anchored inside the print, no more random bits at the ends, embedded in perimeter loops).\n* Options to change holes dimensions and/or geometry, to print them at the right size.\n* Better overhangs (add perimeters if needed, slice them in opposite direction each layer).\n* Brim rework: many more options (inside, outside only, 'ears', per object)\n* Some new seam options, to help hide them.\n* Built-in calibration prints\n* Built-in object generation script\n* Can join perimeters into a big one to avoid travel moves.\n* Many other little options and corrections (like the filled concentric pattern).\n* It has also all the current slic3rPE/PrusaSlicer features.\n\n### Complete changelog [here](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/wiki)\n\nSee the wiki for examples.\n\n### What are SuperSlicer / PrusaSlicer / Slic3r's main features?\n\nKey features are:\n\n* **Multi-platform** (Linux/Mac/Win) and packaged as standalone-app with no dependencies required\n* Complete **command-line interface** to use it without GUI\n* Multi-material **(multiple extruders)** object printing\n* Multiple G-code flavors supported (RepRap, Makerbot, Mach3, Machinekit, etc.)\n* Ability to plate **multiple objects having distinct print settings**\n* **Multithread** processing\n* **STL auto-repair** (tolerance for broken models)\n* Wide automated unit testing\n\nOther major features are:\n\n* Combine infill every 'n' perimeters layer and varying density to speed up printing\n* **3D preview** (including multi-material files)\n* **Multiple layer heights** in a single print\n* **Spiral vase** mode for bumpless vases\n* Fine adjustment of speed, acceleration, and extrusion width\n* Several infill patterns including honeycomb, spirals, Hilbert curves, gyroid\n* Support material, raft, brim, skirt\n* **Standby temperature** and automatic wiping for multi-extruder printing\n* [Customizable **G-code macros**](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/wiki/Slic3r-Prusa-Edition-Macro-Language) and output filename with variable placeholders\n* Support for **post-processing scripts**\n* **Cooling logic** controlling fan speed and dynamic print speed", "updated": "2024-03-23T16:33:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/superslicer/2.4.58.5", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/superslicer/2.4.58.5", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "superslicer", "displayName": "SuperSlicer", "summary": "G-code generator for 3D printers (Prusa, Voron, Creality, etc.)", "version": "2.4.58.5", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/master/resources/icons/SuperSlicer.png", "author": "SuperMerill", "downloadCount": 13955, "tags": ["superslicer", "gcode", "slicer"]}
