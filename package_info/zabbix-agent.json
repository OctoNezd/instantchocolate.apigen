{"description": "This package adds the Zabbix agent executables from the [pre-compiled files](https://www.zabbix.com/download_agents) supplied by [Zabbix LLC](https://www.zabbix.com/).\n\nThe executables are placed in \"%ProgramFiles%\\Zabbix Agent\" and the zabbix_agentd.conf file is stored in \"%ProgramData%\\zabbix\". After this the service will be installed and set to run.\n\nWhen new versions of the agent are installed, the original config is not overwritten but rather the version number of the new file is appended to the name. For example, if version 4.0.0 is installed and then upgraded to version 4.2.1 you will find the sample 4.2.1 config files saved as \u201czabbix_agentd-4.2.1.conf\u201d.\n\nThe source code for this Chocolatey package can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix-agent-chocolatey). Please file any issues you find in the project's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix-agent-chocolatey/issues).\n\n**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is\nout of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and\nlet them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/zabbix-agent/6.4.12", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/zabbix-agent/6.4.12", "licenseUrl": "https://www.zabbix.com/license", "packageName": "zabbix-agent", "displayName": "Zabbix Agent", "summary": "Zabbix Agent v1, Archive for Windows", "version": "6.4.12", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mkevenaar/chocolatey-packages@e2236e33581663e56d2b79755c6a126d960681ec/icons/zabbix-agent.png", "author": "Zabbix LLC", "downloadCount": 1537384, "tags": ["zabbix", "monitoring", "admin"]}
