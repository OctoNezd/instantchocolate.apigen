{"description": "## Sloc Cloc and Code (scc)\n\tA tool similar to cloc, sloccount and tokei. For counting physical the lines of code, blank lines, comment lines, and physical lines of source code in many programming languages.\n\n\tGoal is to be the fastest code counter possible, but also perform COCOMO calculation like sloccount and to estimate code complexity similar to cyclomatic complexity calculators. In short one tool to rule them all.\n\n\tAlso it has a very short name which is easy to type scc.\n\t\n\t**Please Note:** This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-20T20:18:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/scc/3.1.0.20221202", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/scc/3.1.0.20221202", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/boyter/scc/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "scc", "displayName": "Sloc Cloc and Code (scc)", "summary": "Sloc, Cloc and Code: scc is a very fast accurate code counter with complexity calculations and COCOMO estimates written in pure Go", "version": "3.1.0.20221202", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/naveen521kk/au-packages/icons/scc.png", "author": "Ben Boyter + Contributors", "downloadCount": 5871, "tags": ["scc", "cli", "code", "complexity", "sloc", "golang", "statistics"]}
