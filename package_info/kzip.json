{"description": "PKZIP-compatible compressor focusing on space over speed. KZIP creates smaller .ZIP files than PKZIP with maximum compression enabled and even beats 7-Zip most of the time. I use a few tricks beyond what your typical compressor will do. The main one is an exhaustive search of all patterns. The other one is my advanced block splitter. ZIP files created with KZIP are compatible with all of the latest .ZIP software - just that if you use KZIP, your file will probably be smaller. Decompression is still very fast, making KZIP the perfect tool for shaving off seconds from download times.
