{"description": "BES is a small tool that throttles the CPU usage of the process you \u201ctarget\u201d: for instance, you can limit the CPU usage of a process which would use CPU 100%, down to 50% (or any percentage you\u2019d like). With this, you can use other programs comfortably while doing something CPU-intensive in the background. For more than 10 years, BES has also helped various gamers as a handy \u201canti-freeze\u201d agent, though that was not the original purpose of BES.", "updated": "2024-03-13T04:03:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/battle-encoder-shirase/1.7.8", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/battle-encoder-shirase/1.7.8", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html", "packageName": "battle-encoder-shirase", "displayName": "BES - Battle Encoder Shiras\u00e9", "summary": "BES is a small program that throttles the CPU usage", "version": "1.7.8", "icon": "https://mion.yosei.fi/BES/images/bes_logo.png", "author": "Mion Yosei", "downloadCount": 306, "tags": ["bes", "battle-encoder-shirase", "cpu", "throttle", "limit", "slow", "down", "usage", "overheating", "control", "govern"]}
