{"description": "WinHotKey allows you to assign \"hot keys\" that do various things. Actions that can be done with a hotkey are:\n\n- Launch a Program\n- Open a document\n- Open a folder\n- Automatically type something (Sorry, this feature doesn't work on Vista, Windows 7, or later)\n- Control other windows on the screen\n\nThe main goal of this tool is to be easy to use. There are many other hotkey programs out there, but most of them do not provide a sufficient level of \"ease of use\". This walks the user through the options, while remaining a powerful tool.\n\nWhen running, the program sits in the system tray. Double-clicking on the system tray icon will bring up the main window.", "updated": "2024-03-23T14:18:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/winhotkey/0.70.0.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/winhotkey/0.70.0.1", "licenseUrl": "http://directedge.us/content/winhotkey-license", "packageName": "winhotkey", "displayName": "WinHotKey", "summary": "WinHotKey allows you to assign \"hot keys\" that do various things.", "version": "0.70.0.1", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/aronovgj/chocolatey/master/icons/winhotkey.jpeg", "author": "Brian Mathis", "downloadCount": 2665, "tags": ["hotkey", "key", "winhotkey"]}
