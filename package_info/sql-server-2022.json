If a path to an existing .iso is not supplied, it downloads the same .iso that can be obtained from the [SQL Server Basic Installer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2215158)'s *Download Media* menu.\n\n#### Package Parameters\n\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n- `/IsoPath:` - path to a local copy of the .iso file - if not supplied then .iso is downloaded\n- `/IgnorePendingReboot` - don't check for pending reboot (Warning, SQL Server installation may fail if reboots are pending)\n\nAll other package parameters are passed through to SQL Server Setup, allowing you to customise the installation as necessary.\n\nThe following are set by default:\n\n- `/ConfigurationFile:` - The path to a configurationfile.ini - defaults to the supplied tools\\configurationfile.ini\n- `/SQLSYSADMINACCOUNTS:` - A username or group to add to the SQL SysAdmin role - defaults to current user. This option is only set if configurationfile.ini does not contain 'SQLSYSADMINACCOUNTS=' at the start of a line.\n\nSee https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-command-prompt#Install for the full list of parameters supported by SQL Server.\n\nTo pass parameters, use `--params \"''\"` (e.g. `choco install sql-server-2022 [other options] --params=\"'/ITEM:value /ITEM2:value2'\"`).\n\nExample using /IsoPath to use previously downloaded SQL Server .iso\n\n```powershell\nchoco install sql-server-2022 --params=\"'/IsoPath:c:\\downloads\\SQLServer2022-x64-ENU-Dev.iso'\"\n```\n\n#### Chocolatey Pro / Business users\n\nIf you allow the package to download the ISO file, it is suggested you run Chocolatey with the `--skip-virus-check` parameter, as the online virus scanner doesn't handle files over 500MB. You should use alternate methods of scanning in this case.", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:33:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sql-server-2022/16.0.1000.6", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/sql-server-2022/16.0.1000.6", "licenseUrl": "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2022-pricing", "packageName": "sql-server-2022", "displayName": "Microsoft SQL Server 2022 Developer Edition", "summary": "SQL Server 2022 is the most Azure-enabled release of SQL Server yet, with continued innovation in security, availability, and performance.", "version": "16.0.1000.6", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/ferventcoder/chocolatey-packages/59ad5e2e32c52fd2a45a9735f95a81368f9e5e85/icons/microsoft-sql-server.svg", "author": "Microsoft Corporation", "downloadCount": 29108, "tags": ["SQL", "tSQL", "Relational", "Data", "Database"]}
