{"description": "## weasel-pageant\n\n`weasel-pageant` allows you to use SSH keys held by [PuTTY's](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)\nPageant \"daemon\" (or compatible, such as the version of Pageant included in \n[PuTTY-CAC](https://github.com/NoMoreFood/putty-cac) or the SSH agent mode in\n[Gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org/)) from inside the\n[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about).\n\nThe source (and this documentation) is heavily based on\n[`ssh-pageant`](https://github.com/cuviper/ssh-pageant) 1.4 by Josh Stone, which allows\ninteracting with Pageant from Cygwin/MSYS programs.\n\n`weasel-pageant` works like `ssh-agent`, except that it leaves the key storage to\nPuTTY's Pageant.  It sets up an authentication socket and prints the environment\nvariables, which allows the OpenSSH client to use it. It works by executing from the\nWSL side a Win32 helper program which interfaces with Pageant and communicating with\nit through pipes.\n\nIt is probably the most useful if your SSH keys can't be copied to the WSL environment,\nsuch as when using a smart card for SSH authentication. Testing is mainly performed\nwith Pageant-CAC, though Gpg4win has been seen to work in the past. Note that when\nusing Gpg4win, only the SSH agent part will be forwarded. There is no support for\nforwarding the GPG agent socket.\n\n**SECURITY NOTICE:** All the usual security caveats applicable to WSL apply.\nMost importantly, all interaction with the Win32 world happens with the credentials of\nthe user who started the WSL environment. In practice, *if you allow someone else to\nlog in to your WSL environment remotely, they may be able to access the SSH keys stored in\nyour Pageant with `weasel-pageant`.* This is a fundamental feature of WSL; if you\nare not sure of what you're doing, do not allow remote access to your WSL environment\n(e.g. by starting an SSH server).\n\n`weasel-pageant` does not work on a version of Windows 10 older\nthan 1703 (\"Creators Update\"), because it requires the\n[Windows/Ubuntu interoperability support](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/2016/10/19/windows-and-ubuntu-interoperability/)\nfeature shipped with that version. It has been verified to work with versions\nup to and including 1809 (\"October 2018 Update\").", "updated": "2024-03-23T12:03:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/weasel-pageant.portable/1.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/weasel-pageant.portable/1.4", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/vuori/weasel-pageant/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "weasel-pageant.portable", "displayName": "weasel-pageant (Portable)", "summary": "weasel-pageant", "version": "1.4", "icon": "", "author": "Valtteri Vuorikoski", "downloadCount": 7701, "tags": ["weasel-pageant", "pageant", "putty", "ssh", "wsl"]}
