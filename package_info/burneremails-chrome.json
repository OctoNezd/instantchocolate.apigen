If later on you don't want to receive emails from them anymore, you can disable or delete your address and be done with them! It's like your very own unsubscribe button that actually works on every email ever sent.\t\n\t\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/burneremails-chrome/readme.md)**", "updated": "2024-03-08T11:03:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/burneremails-chrome/0.1.7", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/burneremails-chrome/0.1.7", "licenseUrl": "https://burnermail.io/terms-and-conditions", "packageName": "burneremails-chrome", "displayName": "Burner Emails for Chrome", "summary": "Burner Emails: Easy, Fast, Disposable Emails", "version": "0.1.7", "icon": "https://burnermail.io/assets/burnermail-logo-5f6578df2864488190819fcb983a94456780ea35ecff8626941d1714a89f3f0a.png", "author": "burnermail.io", "downloadCount": 646, "tags": ["burner", "email", "chrome", "extension"]}
