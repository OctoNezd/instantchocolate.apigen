{"description": "# AWS Command Line Interface\n\nThe AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.\n\nThe AWS CLI v2 offers several new [features](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-cli-v2-is-now-generally-available/) including improved installers, new configuration options such as AWS Single Sign-On (SSO), and various interactive features.\n\n## Maintainer's Note\n\nI produce and maintain Chocolatey packages in my spare time, for free. If you use my packages, and appreciate the time and effort I put into making and maintaining them, please consider [making a small donation](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jtcmedia).
