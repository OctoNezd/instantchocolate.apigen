{"description": "Ever notice how people texting at night have that eerie blue glow?\n\nOr wake up ready to write down the Next Great Idea, and get blinded by your computer screen?\n\nDuring the day, computer screens look good\u2014they're designed to look like the sun. But, at 9PM, 10PM, or 3AM, you probably shouldn't be looking at the sun.\n\nf.lux fixes this: it makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.\n\nIt's even possible that you're staying up too late because of your computer. You could use f.lux because it makes you sleep better, or you could just use it just because it makes your computer look better.\n\nf.lux makes your computer screen look like the room you're in, all the time. When the sun sets, it makes your computer look like your indoor lights. In the morning, it makes things look like sunlight again.\n\nTell f.lux what kind of lighting you have, and where you live. Then forget about it. f.lux will do the rest, automatically.\n\nYou can pass the following parameters:\n\n* `/noautostart` - By default a shortcut to f.lux will be created in your `Startup` folder so that it starts with Windows. Use this parameter to stop this behaviour.\n\nExamples:\n\n`-params '\"/noautostart\"'`\n\nNOTE: This is the portable version of f.lux and installs in the Chocolatey tools folder - use this version if you want f.lux to be available to everybody on your system.\n\n**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-22T23:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/f.lux.portable/4.134.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/f.lux.portable/4.134.0", "licenseUrl": "https://justgetflux.com/news/pages/eula/", "packageName": "f.lux.portable", "displayName": "f.lux (Portable)", "summary": "f.lux - Better lighting...for your computer", "version": "4.134.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pauby/ChocoPackages@cc266fa2/icons/flux.png", "author": "Flux Software LLC", "downloadCount": 6411, "tags": ["f.lux", "flux", "lighting", "monitor", "color", "admin", "notsilent"]}
