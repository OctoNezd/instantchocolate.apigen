{"description": "'Oxygen Font' is a project to design a desktop/gui font for integrated use with the KDE desktop. The design is based on interpolations between 'Muli' and 'FontOne' that have been further shaped to reach a clear, legible font to use within the KDE gui.\n\nThe basic concept for 'Oxygen Font' was to design a clear, legible, sans serif, that would be rendered with Freetype on Linux-based devices. The idea was to not quite follow a 'purist' line of sans serif typeface formulae, but to allow some juxtapositioning of font forms to give familiarity but also a sense of newness. A version of the font is also under development that is aimed to be a branding typeface for the desktop.", "updated": "2024-03-21T20:18:48Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/OxygenMono/2014.12.31", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/OxygenMono/2014.12.31", "licenseUrl": "http://scripts.sil.org/OFL", "packageName": "OxygenMono", "displayName": "Oxygen Mono", "summary": "", "version": "2014.12.31", "icon": "", "author": "Vernon Adams", "downloadCount": 2431, "tags": ["font", "monospace", "monospaced", "oxygen", "oxygenMono", "mono", "fixedWidth", "fixed"]}
