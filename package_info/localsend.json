{"description": "## LocalSend\n\nLocalSend is a cross-platform app that enables secure communication between devices using a REST API and HTTPS encryption. Unlike other messaging apps that rely on external servers, LocalSend doesn't require an internet connection or third-party servers, making it a fast and reliable solution for local communication.\n\nLocalSend uses a secure communication protocol that allows devices to communicate with each other using a REST API. All data is sent securely over HTTPS, and the TLS/SSL certificate is generated on the fly on each device, ensuring maximum security.\n\nFor more information on the LocalSend Protocol, see the [documentation](https://github.com/localsend/protocol).\n\n![LocalSend Screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/brogers5/chocolatey-package-localsend@6414b40023c2c8fa002621c682a5dc6dd92e3f14/Screenshot.png)", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:18:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/localsend/1.14.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/localsend/1.14.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/localsend/localsend/blob/v1.14.0/LICENSE", "packageName": "localsend", "displayName": "LocalSend", "summary": "An open source cross-platform alternative to AirDrop", "version": "1.14.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/brogers5/chocolatey-package-localsend@6414b40023c2c8fa002621c682a5dc6dd92e3f14/localsend.png", "author": "Tien Do Nam", "downloadCount": 6349, "tags": ["localsend", "message", "file", "transfer", "64-bit", "cross-platform", "foss"]}
