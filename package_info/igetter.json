This package is published by the software vendor itself and includes the official release of iGetter.\n\nCurrently, Cynet is the only antivirus engine that flags our product on VirusTotal. We contacted Cynet about this false positive and they corrected their engine. But after a month, Cynet again wrongly flagged the same file. The main executable iGetter.exe is all green with all antivirus engines including Cynet. The flagged file is named iGetter_x86.exe, which is a Native messaging host required for iGetter browser extension in Chromium based browsers.\n\nHere are some other antivirus reports which found iGetter as `100% clean`. Softpedia and Download3k have downloaded and tested version 3.0.0 of iGetter using several antivirus engines. They have found it to be clean of any form of badware (viruses, spyware, adware, etc.).
