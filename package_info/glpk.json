{"description": "**NOTE:** The following text is an excerpt from [the official website](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk).\n\n# GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit)\n\nThe GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) package is intended for solving large-scale linear programming (LP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and other related problems. It is a set of routines written in ANSI C and organized in the form of a callable library.\n\nGLPK supports the GNU MathProg modeling language, which is a subset of the AMPL language.\n\nThe GLPK package includes the following main components:\n* primal and dual simplex methods\n* primal-dual interior-point method\n* branch-and-cut method\n* translator for GNU MathProg\n* application program interface (API)\n* stand-alone LP/MIP solver", "updated": "2024-03-22T20:18:42Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/glpk/5.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/glpk/5.0.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html", "packageName": "glpk", "displayName": "GNU Linear Programming Kit", "summary": "GLPK is intended for solving large-scale linear programming (LP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and other related problems.", "version": "5.0.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jakublevy/chocopkgs/icons/glpk.png", "author": "Andrew Makhorin", "downloadCount": 9327, "tags": ["mathprog", "linear-programming", "LP", "MIP", "optimization", "solver", "gnu", "commandline"]}
