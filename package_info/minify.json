{"description": "Minify is a minifier package written in Go. It provides HTML5, CSS3, JS, JSON, SVG and XML minifiers and an interface to implement any other minifier. Minification is the process of removing bytes from a file (such as whitespace) without changing its output and therefore shrinking its size and speeding up transmission over the internet and possibly parsing. The implemented minifiers are designed for high performance.", "updated": "2024-03-23T09:18:55Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/minify/2.20.19", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/minify/2.20.19", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/tdewolff/minify/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "minify", "displayName": "Minify", "summary": ">Minify provides HTML5, CSS3, JS, JSON, SVG and XML minification", "version": "2.20.19", "icon": "", "author": "Taco de Wolff", "downloadCount": 4522, "tags": ["html", "css", "js", "xml", "svg", "json", "cross-platform", "cli", "foss"]}
