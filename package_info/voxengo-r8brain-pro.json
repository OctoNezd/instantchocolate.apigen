{"description": "8brain PRO is a professional sample rate converter tool software designed to deliver an unprecedented sample rate conversion (SRC) quality.  Unlike other existing SRC algorithms available on the market, r8brain PRO implements sample rate conversion processing in its full potential: interpolation and decimation steps without exploiting any kind of simplifications; the signal is resampled in a multi-step manner using a series of least common multiple sample rates which makes conversion perfect \u2013 both in signal-to-noise and timing precision aspects.  Such whole number-factored SRC can be considered a golden standard in sample rate conversion as it is not subject to jitter and timing errors.\n\n## Package Specific\n\n### Package Parameters\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n * `/NoShortcuts`     - Do not install shortcuts to manuals and uninstaller into start menu or onto desktop\n * `/InstallerPath:`  - Do not download the installer from the official Voxengo website and use the one passed with this argument instead. Use it, if you don't have an internet connection at your studio computer.\n * `/CompanyPath:`    - Path of the company to put all program files in. Override if you want to have the program files at a custom location.\n\nYou must pass the package parameters like this:\n```\n$ProgramFiles = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('ProgramFiles') + \"\\Voxengo\"\nchoco install voxengo-r8brain-pro --package-parameters \"'/NoShortcuts /InstallerPath:$ProgramFiles '\"\n```", "updated": "2024-02-20T14:33:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/voxengo-r8brain-pro/2.12.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/voxengo-r8brain-pro/2.12.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.voxengo.com/terms-of-use/", "packageName": "voxengo-r8brain-pro", "displayName": "Voxengo r8brain PRO (Install)", "summary": "An audio samplerate converter by Voxengo.", "version": "2.12.0", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/Schroedingers-Cat/chocolatey-audio-plugins/ec679a5234d2ba0ef5dc8846d48cd399ccef1541/Icons/r8brainPro.png", "author": "Voxengo", "downloadCount": 1600, "tags": ["r8brain-pro", "audio", "mixing", "mastering", "recording", "samplerate", "conversion", "trial"]}
