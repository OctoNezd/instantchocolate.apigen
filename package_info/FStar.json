{"description": "F* (pronounced F star) is a general-purpose functional programming language with effects aimed at program verification. It puts together the automation of an SMT-backed deductive verification tool with the expressive power of a proof assistant based on dependent types. After verification, F* programs can be extracted to efficient OCaml, F#, or C code. This enables verifying the functional correctness and security of realistic applications, such as a verified HTTPS stack.\n\nF*'s type system includes dependent types, monadic effects, refinement types, and a weakest precondition calculus. Together, these features allow expressing precise and compact specifications for programs, including functional correctness and security properties. The F* type-checker aims to prove that programs meet their specifications using a combination of SMT solving and interactive proofs.", "updated": "2024-03-12T09:48:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/FStar/2024.1.13", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/FStar/2024.1.13", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "FStar", "displayName": "F* language", "summary": "An ML-like language aimed at program verification", "version": "2024.1.13", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AdmiringWorm/chocolatey-packages@f60250eb91925e4aafa8cd69d4af9d50a067d5ca/automatic/fstar/icons/fstar.png", "author": "FStarLang", "downloadCount": 5336, "tags": ["fstar", "programming_language", "proof_assistant", "dependent_type", "fsharp", "ocaml", "foss", "cross-platform"]}
