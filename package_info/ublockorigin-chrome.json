{"description": "uBlock Origin is a free and open-source, cross-platform browser extension for content-filtering, including ad-blocking. The extension is available for several browsers: Safari (beta), Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Firefox, and Opera. uBlock Origin has received praise from technology websites, and is reported to be much less memory-intensive than other extensions with similar functionality. uBlock Origin's stated purpose is to give users the means to enforce their own (content-filtering) choices.\n\nThanks to bcurran3 for helping me with the scripts with /packages/feedly-chrome.\nThanks to proudcanadianeh for the idea with /packages/uBlockOrigin-firefox\n\n####PACKAGING NOTE: This installs no software. It installs a registry key for the extension that Chrome will see and then ask you for permission to enable the extension if you are in Chrome or on the next run. Chrome will install the latest version of the extension. The mentioned version is the version at time of packaging, you can ignore it. Chrome will handle updates to the extension.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ublockorigin-chrome/1.19.6", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ublockorigin-chrome/1.19.6", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "ublockorigin-chrome", "displayName": "uBlock Origin for Chrome", "summary": "uBlock Origin Chrome extension", "version": "1.19.6", "icon": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/UBlock_Origin.svg/1200px-UBlock_Origin.svg.png", "author": "https://www.ublock.org/", "downloadCount": 655592, "tags": ["uBlock", "chrome", "extension", "ads", "blocking"]}
