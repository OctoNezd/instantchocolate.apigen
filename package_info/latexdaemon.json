{"description": "LaTeXDaemon simplifies and accelerates your LaTeX processing workflow. It runs silently in the background and automatically recompiles your document when a change is detected, so you can focus on editing your document using your favorite file editor while avoiding round trips with the command prompt. Additionally, it speeds up compilation by pre-compiling the preamble section of your LaTeX source that loads packages (`\\usepackage{...}`).", "updated": "2024-03-13T14:48:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/latexdaemon/0.11.92", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/latexdaemon/0.11.92", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/blumu/latexdaemon/blob/master/LICENSE.md", "packageName": "latexdaemon", "displayName": "latexdaemon (Install)", "summary": "LaTeXDaemon speeds-up compilation of LaTeX documents through background monitoring of source files and automatic preamble precompilation.", "version": "0.11.92", "icon": "https://github.com/blumu/latexdaemon/blob/master/latexdaemon/latexdaemon.ico", "author": "William Blum", "downloadCount": 1266, "tags": ["latexdaemon", "latex", "tex", "daemon"]}
