Everyone in an Among Us lobby with this program running will be able to communicate over voice in-game, with no third-party programs required. Spatial audio ensures that you can only hear people close to you.\n\n## Installation\n\nDownload the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/ottomated/CrewLink/releases) and run the `CrewLink-Setup-X.X.X.exe` file.
