{"description": "Microsoft Expression Blend 3 introduces behaviors, which are reusable pieces of packaged code that can be dragged onto any object, and then fine-tuned by changing their properties. Behaviors allow you to add interactivity to your applications without having to write any code. The Behavior API consists of three core classes: Trigger, Action and Behavior. This SDK explores how to write each of these components, and contains a few code samples to help you get started. Programming reference topics are provided for both Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Microsoft Silverlight. For more how-to and overview information about behaviors in Expression Blend, see the Expression Blend User Guide, available when you install Expression Blend 3 + SketchFlow.\n\nThe Expression Blend 3 SDK also contains the following redistributable components:\n\n* SketchFlow Player\n* Custom VSM for Fluid Layout\n* Font Embedding enhancements\n\nThe Expression Blend 3 SDK is required to view an Expression Blend 3 project that uses any of these components if Expression Blend 3 is not installed.", "updated": "2024-03-20T14:03:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ExpressionBlend3/1.0.1340.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ExpressionBlend3/1.0.1340.0", "licenseUrl": "http://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/get-started/install/License.aspx", "packageName": "ExpressionBlend3", "displayName": "Microsoft Expression Blend 3 SDK", "summary": "The Expression Blend Software Development Kit (SDK) allows you to extend the capabilities of behaviors in Expression Blend.", "version": "1.0.1340.0", "icon": "", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 981, "tags": ["expression", "blend", "expressionblend", "expressionblend3", "blend3", "sdk", "microsoft"]}
