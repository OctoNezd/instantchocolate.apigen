{"description": "## Package Parameters\n* `/GNU` - Install GNU ABI executable instead of native MSVC ABI.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bootandy/dust.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bootandy/dust)\n\ndu + rust = dust. Like du but more intuitive.\n\n# Demo\n![Example](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/bootandy/dust/1d018bc8/media/snap.png)\n\n## Overview\n\nDust is meant to give you an instant overview of which directories are using disk space without requiring sort or head. Dust will print a maximum of one 'Did not have permissions message'.\n\nDust will list a slightly-less-than-the-terminal-height number of the biggest subdirectories or files and will smartly recurse down the tree to find the larger ones. There is no need for a '-d' flag or a '-h' flag. The largest subdirectories will be colored.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nUsage: dust\nUsage: dust <dir>\nUsage: dust <dir>  <another_dir> <and_more>\nUsage: dust -p <dir>  (full-path - does not shorten the path of the subdirectories)\nUsage: dust -s <dir>  (apparent-size - shows the length of the file as opposed to the amount of disk space it uses)\nUsage: dust -n 30  <dir>  (shows 30 directories instead of the default)\nUsage: dust -d 3  <dir>  (shows 3 levels of subdirectories)\nUsage: dust -r  <dir>  (reverse order of output, with root at the lowest)\nUsage: dust -x  <dir>  (only show directories on the same filesystem)\nUsage: dust -X ignore  <dir>  (ignore all files and directories with the name 'ignore')\nUsage: dust -b <dir>  (do not show percentages or draw ASCII bars)\n```\n\nNote: Apparent-size is calculated slightly differently in dust to gdu. In dust each hard link is counted as using file_length space. In gdu only the first entry is counted.", "updated": "2024-03-23T01:48:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dust/0.8.5", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/dust/0.8.5", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/bootandy/dust/blob/v0.8.5/LICENSE", "packageName": "dust", "displayName": "Dust", "summary": "A more intuitive version of du in rust", "version": "0.8.5", "icon": "", "author": "Andy Boot", "downloadCount": 3498, "tags": ["gnu", "du", "unix", "cli", "foss"]}
