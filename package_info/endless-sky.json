{"description": "Endless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to Elite, Escape Velocity, or Star Control. You start out as the captain of a tiny spaceship and can choose what to do from there. The game includes a major plot line and many minor missions, but you can choose whether you want to play through the plot or strike out on your own as a merchant or bounty hunter or explorer.\n\n**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-18T00:03:56Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/endless-sky/0.10.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/endless-sky/0.10.2", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/blob/master/license.txt", "packageName": "endless-sky", "displayName": "Endless Sky", "summary": "Space exploration, trading, and combat game.", "version": "0.10.2", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mikeee/ChocoPackages/icons/endless-sky.png", "author": "Michael Zahniser and endless-sky contributors", "downloadCount": 266, "tags": ["endless", "sky", "endlesssky", "space", "exploration", "trading", "combat", "game"]}
