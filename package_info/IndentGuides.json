{"description": "Displays indent guides in Visual Studio text editor windows.\n\nGuides can be displayed at the indent specified in your settings, regardless of tabs or spaces, or wherever text has been indented to.\n\nThere are three styles of guides: solid, dotted and dashed, available in thin and thick varieties and customizable color. The default is dotted teal, as shown in the image. Each indent level can have a different style and color.\n\nThe deepest guide that includes the block with the caret is displayed in a different color or a glow, to help you find the start and end of your code. Guides can be shown and customized for any language in Visual Studio. It reads the spaces, not the code.", "updated": "2024-03-17T02:33:51Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/IndentGuides/12.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/IndentGuides/12.1", "licenseUrl": "http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/site/e792686d-542b-474a-8c55-630980e72c30/eula?licenseType=None", "packageName": "IndentGuides", "displayName": "Indent Guides", "summary": "Adds vertical lines at each indent level.", "version": "12.1", "icon": "", "author": "Steve Dower", "downloadCount": 1797, "tags": ["vsix", "visualstudio", "indent", "guide"]}
