{"description": "FRAGSTATS is a public domain computer software program designed to compute a wide variety of landscape metrics for categorical map patterns.The original software (version 2) was released in the public domain during 1995.  The program was completely revamped in 2002 (version 3). Recently, the program was upgraded to accommodate ArcGIS10 (version 3.4). The latest release (version 4) reflects a major revamping of the software, with a completely redesigned architecture intended to support the addition of cell-level metrics and surface pattern metrics. The current release of version 4 (v4.2) has essentially the same functionality as version 3, but with a new user interface that reflects the redesign of the model architecture, support for additional image formats, and a variety of sampling methods for analyzing sub-landscapes.\n\n#### Raster Image Formats:\n* ASCII grid\n* 8-, 16- and 32-bit integer grids\n* ESRI grid (or raster)\n* GeoTIFF grid\n* VTP binary terrain format grid\n* ESRI header labelled grid\n* ERDAS Imagine grid\n* PCRaster grid\n* SAGA GIS binary format grid\n\n#### Features\n* Graphical user interface\n* Command line execution\n* Patch-based metrics\n* Cell-based metrics\n* Surface metrics\n* Structural and functional metrics\n* Batch processing\n* Multiple sampling strategies\n* Handles nodata, background and border cells\n\n#### Package Parameters\nIf you have a valid ESRI ArcGIS license with Spatial Analyst or ArcView 3.3 Spatial Analyst and intend to work with ArcGrids (or Rasters), you can use a `/DLL` package parameter to add the necessary folder path of the `aigridio.dll` library file.  *This path is not verified.*\n\nFor example : \n  `choco install fragstats -params '\"/DLL:\"\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ArcGIS\\Desktop10.2\\Bin\"\"\"'`.\n_(note: the double-double quotes around the path are only needed if it contains spaces)_", "updated": "2024-03-20T12:18:34Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/fragstats/4.2.0.20171213", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/fragstats/4.2.0.20171213", "licenseUrl": "http://www.umass.edu/landeco/research/fragstats/downloads/fragstats_downloads.html", "packageName": "fragstats", "displayName": "FRAGSTATS", "summary": "Spatial Pattern Analysis Program for Categorical Maps", "version": "4.2.0.20171213", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages/master/Icons/fragstats_icon.png", "author": "Dr. Kevin McGarigal,  Dr. Sam Cushman,  Eduard Ene", "downloadCount": 1619, "tags": ["fragstats", "landscape", "metrics", "maps", "gis", "arcgis", "admin"]}
