{"description": "# Draft: Streamlined Kubernetes Development\nDraft makes it easy to build applications that run on Kubernetes. Draft targets the \"inner loop\" of a developer's workflow: as they hack on code, but before code is committed to version control.\n\n## _NOTE: Draft is experimental and does not have a stable release yet._\nAs an example, starting with the 0.12 release Draft moves the containment and deployment engine to your local machine. This changes quite a bit about how Draft works compared to prior releases; for details, see the changelog.\n\n## Overview\n\nUsing Draft is as simple as:\n\n1. `draft init` to set up draft (after prerequisites are installed)\n2. `draft create` to containerize your application based on Draft packs\n3. `draft up` to deploy your application to a Kubernetes dev sandbox, accessible using `draft connect` over a secured tunnel.\n4. Use a local editor to modify the application, with changes deployed to Kubernetes in seconds.", "updated": "2024-03-19T23:03:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/draft/0.16.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/draft/0.16.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/Azure/draft/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "draft", "displayName": "Draft: A tool for developers to create cloud-native applications on Kubernetes.", "summary": "A tool for developers to create cloud-native applications on Kubernetes.", "version": "0.16.0", "icon": "https://draft.sh/assets/images/draft-sm.png", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 4519, "tags": ["draft", "kubernetes", "docker", "containers"]}
