{"description": "# Yggdrasil\n\nYggdrasil is an early-stage implementation of a fully end-to-end encrypted IPv6\nnetwork. It is lightweight, self-arranging, supported on multiple platforms and\nallows pretty much any IPv6-capable application to communicate securely with\nother Yggdrasil nodes. Yggdrasil does not require you to have IPv6 Internet\nconnectivity - it also works over IPv4.\n\nAlthough Yggdrasil shares many similarities with [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns), it employs a different routing\nalgorithm based on a globally-agreed spanning tree and greedy routing in a\nmetric space, and aims to implement some novel local backpressure routing\ntechniques. In theory, Yggdrasil should scale well on networks with\ninternet-like topologies.", "updated": "2024-03-23T17:18:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/yggdrasil/0.5.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/yggdrasil/0.5.4", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "yggdrasil", "displayName": "Yggdrasil Network", "summary": "An experiment in scalable routing as an encrypted IPv6 overlay network", "version": "0.5.4", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/r4sas/chocolatey-packages/fcc1f799/yggdrasil/icon/yggdrasil.svg", "author": "Yggdrasil Network", "downloadCount": 28569, "tags": ["yggdrasil", "admin", "network", "encryption", "security", "mesh", "ipv6", "decentralized"]}
