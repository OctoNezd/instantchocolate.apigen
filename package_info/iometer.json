{"description": "![Screenshot of Iometer](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/proj/iometer/screenshots/11336.jpg)\n\nIometer is an I/O subsystem measurement and characterization tool for single and\nclustered systems. Iometer is pronounced \u201ceye-OM-i-ter,\u201d to rhyme with\n\u201cthermometer.\u201d Iometer does for a computer\u2019s I/O subsystem what a dynamometer\ndoes for an engine: it measures performance under a controlled load. Iometer was\nformerly known as \u201cGalileo.\u201d\n\nIometer is both a workload generator (that is, it performs I/O operations in order to\nstress the system) and a measurement tool (that is, it examines and records the\nperformance of its I/O operations and their impact on the system). It can be configured\nto emulate the disk or network I/O load of any program or benchmark, or can be used\nto generate entirely synthetic I/O loads. It can generate and measure loads on single or\nmultiple (networked) systems.\n\nIometer can be used for measurement and characterization of:\n\n* Performance of disk and network controllers.\n* Bandwidth and latency capabilities of buses.\n* Network throughput to attached drives.\n* Shared bus performance.\n* System-level hard drive performance.\n* System-level network performance.", "updated": "2024-03-23T04:18:51Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/iometer/1.1.0.20161009", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/iometer/1.1.0.20161009", "licenseUrl": "https://sourceforge.net/p/iometer/svn/HEAD/tree/trunk/IOmeter/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "iometer", "displayName": "Iometer (Install)", "summary": "I/O performance Analysis Tool", "version": "1.1.0.20161009", "icon": "https://a.fsdn.com/allura/p/iometer/icon", "author": "Intel Corporation,  Sean Hefty,  David Levine,  and Fab Tillier", "downloadCount": 4502, "tags": ["iometer", "benchmark", "hardware", "networking", "admin"]}
