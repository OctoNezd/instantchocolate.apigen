{"description": "*\"Windows Subsystem for Linux lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup\"* - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about>\n\n## Package parameters\n\n- `/Version:1` - the version of WSL to install. Defaults to `2`\n- `/Retry:true` - whether to retry install on logon after computer is restarted for WSL 2. Ignored when `Version` is `1` and it defaults to `false`\n\nExample: `choco install wsl2 --params \"/Version:2 /Retry:true\"`\n\n## Note\n\n- There are checks that are performed to ensure the system supports WSL 1 or 2. If any of these checks fail, the install will fail.\n- WSL 1 requires a restart before it can be used if this is a fresh install of Windows.\n- WSL 2 requires a restart before it can be installed if WSL 1 wasn't installed previously. Otherwise, it will be enabled if it detects WSL 1. <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#update-to-wsl-2>\n- **Important**:\n  - `/Retry:true` should only be set when installing WSL 2 on systems that didn't have WSL 1. Setting this param to `true` will schedule a self deleting task if script didn't detect WSL. That task if created will run `choco install wsl2 -y -f` in a powershell window after the computer is restarted.\n  - `/Retry:false` you will have to run `choco install wsl2 -f` again manually after a restart if script didn't detect WSL.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/wsl2/2.0.0.20210721", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/wsl2/2.0.0.20210721", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "wsl2", "displayName": "Windows Subsystem for Linux 2", "summary": "Windows Subsystem for Linux 2", "version": "2.0.0.20210721", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages/15cb498f3d11b3687c99e98d077031ad85a62c96/icons/win10mct.png", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 1286715, "tags": ["wsl", "wsl2", "windows-subsystem-for-linux"]}
