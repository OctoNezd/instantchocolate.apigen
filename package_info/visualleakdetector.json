{"description": "Visual Leak Detector is a free, robust, open-source memory leak detection system for Visual C++.\n                  It's pretty easy to use. After installing it, you just need to tell Visual C++ where to find the included header and library file.\n                  Then it can be used with any C/C++ project simply by adding the following line to your code:#include vld.h  \n                  When you run your program under the Visual Studio debugger, Visual Leak Detector will output a memory leak report at the end of your debugging session.\n                  The leak report includes the full call stack showing how any leaked memory blocks were allocated.\n                  Double-click on a line in the call stack to jump to that file and line in the editor window. \n                  It's a very effective way to quickly diagnose, and fix, memory leaks in C/C++ applications.\n                  The main difference between the  CRT Debug Library and VLD, is that Visual Leak Detector shows  you the complete  callstack used for memory allocation has led to the leak.", "updated": "2024-03-22T23:03:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/visualleakdetector/2.5.7", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/visualleakdetector/2.5.7", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/Azure/vld/blob/master/COPYING.txt", "packageName": "visualleakdetector", "displayName": "Visual Leak Detector", "summary": "Visual Leak Detector is a free, robust, open-source memory leak detection system for Visual C++.", "version": "2.5.7", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/Thieum/ChocolateyPackages/3f8b61a8/visualleakdetector/vld_icon.png", "author": "Dan Moulding,   Arkadiy Shapkin", "downloadCount": 9556, "tags": ["visual", "leak", "detector", "c++", "admin"]}
