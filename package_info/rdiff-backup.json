{"description": "rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over a network. The target directory ends up a copy of the source directory, but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that target directory, so you can still recover files lost some time ago. The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental backup. Rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories, hard links, dev files, permissions, uid/gid ownership (if it is running as root), modification times, acls, eas, resource forks, etc. Finally, rdiff-backup can operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only the differences will be transmitted.", "updated": "2024-03-22T00:03:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rdiff-backup/2.2.6", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/rdiff-backup/2.2.6", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/rdiff-backup/rdiff-backup/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "rdiff-backup", "displayName": "rdiff-backup", "summary": "Reverse differential backup tool, over a network or locally", "version": "2.2.6", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/rdiff-backup/rdiff-backup/2ac8f943d34de9ff7888c48b5af9628faad32746/docs/resources/logo-a.svg", "author": "rdiff-backup contributors", "downloadCount": 2215, "tags": ["admin", "backup", "rdiff", "rdiff-backup", "rsync"]}
