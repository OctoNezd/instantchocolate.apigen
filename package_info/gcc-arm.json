{"description": "As part of its ongoing commitment to maintaining and enhancing GCC compiler support for the ARM architecture, ARM is maintaining a GNU toolchain with a GCC source branch targeted at Embedded ARM Processors, namely Cortex-R/Cortex-M processor families, covering Cortex-R4, Cortex-R5, Cortex-M0, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M4, and Cortex-M0+. As part of this, ARM will, at regular intervals, release binaries pre-built and tested from the ARM embedded branch. The improvements will be freely available for integration into 3rd party toolchains, and for direct download by end-users.", "updated": "2024-03-23T23:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gcc-arm/4.8.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/gcc-arm/4.8.1", "licenseUrl": "https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded", "packageName": "gcc-arm", "displayName": "GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors", "summary": "Pre-built GNU toolchain from ARM Cortex-M & Cortex-R processors (Cortex-M0/M0+/M3/M4, Cortex-R4/R5/R7)", "version": "4.8.1", "icon": "", "author": "Joey Ye", "downloadCount": 3920, "tags": ["gcc", "arm"]}
