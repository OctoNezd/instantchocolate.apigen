{"description": "DMXControl 2 is the versatile and well-tried light control software for theater, disco and show lighting. Though it is based on a DMX channel oriented control concept, it still offers functions which aren't integrated in DMXControl 3 yet. So Lightshows synchronized with music can easily be created and the textbook module is unrivalled.\n\nImportant: Those, who do not want to create music-synchronized light shows or dont want to use the textbook should use DMXControl 3 instead since DMXControl 2 isn't developed further any more!", "updated": "2024-03-08T15:33:32Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dmxcontrol2/2.12.2", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/dmxcontrol2/2.12.2", "licenseUrl": "http://cdn.rawgit.com/stefan-muc/chocolatey-packages/master/dmxcontrol2/tools/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "dmxcontrol2", "displayName": "DMXControl 2", "summary": "DMXControl 2 offers many functions for a successful light show", "version": "2.12.2", "icon": "http://cdn.rawgit.com/stefan-muc/chocolatey-packages/master/dmxcontrol2/icons/DMXControl.png", "author": "DMXControl Projects e.V.", "downloadCount": 176, "tags": ["DMXControl", "DMXControl2", "DMX", "LightControl", "RGB", "MovingHead"]}
