{"description": ".NET Core is a general purpose development platform maintained by Microsoft and the .NET community on GitHub. It is cross-platform, supporting Windows, macOS and Linux, and can be used in device, cloud, and embedded/IoT scenarios.\n\nThis package is required to run console applications with the .NET Core runtime. The .NET Core Runtime is installed in the Chocolatey package installation directory, enabling side-by-side install of multiple versions. No shims are generated by default, so this package will also coexist peacefully with the [dotnetcore-runtime.install](https://chocolatey.org/packages/dotnetcore-runtime.install) package. To enable side-by-side installs, pass the `--sxs` argument to Chocolatey when installing this package.\n\n.NET Core supports Windows 7 SP1 / Server 2008 R2 or later. On Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2, [security update KB2533623](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2533623) must be installed, according to [documented system requirements](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/prereqs.md).\n\nThe package supports the following parameters (--package-parameters, --params):\n\n- `ShimDotnetExe` - allows Chocolatey to generate a shim for dotnet.exe, effectively adding dotnet.exe to PATH\n\nExample: cinst -y --params=\"ShimDotnetExe\" dotnetcore-runtime.portable", "updated": "2024-03-17T02:18:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dotnetcore-runtime.portable/3.1.32", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/dotnetcore-runtime.portable/3.1.32", "licenseUrl": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/dotnet/core/290743955c7dec3315e72da5dcd589b2bd177e71/LICENSE", "packageName": "dotnetcore-runtime.portable", "displayName": "Microsoft .NET Core Runtime (Portable)", "summary": "This package is required to run console applications with the .NET Core runtime.", "version": "3.1.32", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/dotnetcore-chocolatey/dotnetcore-chocolateypackages/5a90ffc61572e8403cb88c325f88cf6989de8c79/icons/dotnetcore.png", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 18385, "tags": ["microsoft", ".net", "core", "runtime", "redistributable"]}
