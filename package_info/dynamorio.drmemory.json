{"description": "Dr. Memory is an open-source memory debugger built on DynamoRIO and released under an LGPL license. Dr. Memory monitors memory allocations and memory accesses using shadow memory. It detects memory-related programming errors such as accesses of uninitialized memory, accesses to freed memory, heap overflow and underflow, and memory leaks. Its feature set is similar to that of the Valgrind-based Memcheck tool, though it operates on Windows as well as Linux and is twice as fast as Memcheck.", "updated": "2024-03-19T07:18:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dynamorio.drmemory/2.2.0.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/dynamorio.drmemory/2.2.0.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/DynamoRIO/drmemory/raw/master/license.txt", "packageName": "dynamorio.drmemory", "displayName": "DynamoRIO.drmemory (Portable)", "summary": "Dr. Memory monitors memory allocations and memory accesses using shadow memory.
