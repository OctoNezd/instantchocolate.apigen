{"description": "Kafka is a distributed streaming platform. What exactly does that mean?\n\nWe think of a streaming platform as having three key capabilities:\n\nIt lets you publish and subscribe to streams of records. In this respect it is similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.\nIt lets you store streams of records in a fault-tolerant way.\nIt lets you process streams of records as they occur.\nWhat is Kafka good for?\n\nIt gets used for two broad classes of application:\n\nBuilding real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications\nBuilding real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data\nTo understand how Kafka does these things, let's dive in and explore Kafka's capabilities from the bottom up.\n\nFirst a few concepts:\n\nKafka is run as a cluster on one or more servers.\nThe Kafka cluster stores streams of records in categories called topics.\nEach record consists of a key, a value, and a timestamp.\n\nThis is an automatic package.", "updated": "2024-03-23T03:18:38Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/kafka/1.1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/kafka/1.1.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/LICENSE", "packageName": "kafka", "displayName": "Kafka", "summary": "Kafka is a distributed streaming platform", "version": "1.1.0", "icon": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Apache_kafka.png", "author": "Kafka", "downloadCount": 9608, "tags": ["data", "kafka", "streaming", "admin"]}
