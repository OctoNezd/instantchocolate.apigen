{"description": "ZSNES emulates the Super Nintendo (SNES) game console, a 16-bit video game console that was very popular when released in the early 1990s.\n\nZSNES has a lot of features (e.g. speed options, fast-forward function, image upscaling, multiplayer gameplay using a TCP/IP network, use of cheats, save states support, movie recording etc.) that are best described in ZSNES Documentation ( available as a HTML or TXT file) found in \"docs\" folder (after you extract the content of ZSNES archive). \n\nTo be able to play older cartridge-based ROM games you need the ROM images. Obviously, due to legal issues, ZSNES does not provide such files.\n\nOfficial ports exist for Linux, DOS, Mac OS X, Windows, and an unofficial port for Xbox.\n\n### Requirements\n* ZSNES for Windows requires DirectX 8.0 or greater to run.  Note, DirectX 8.0 was released November 12, 2000.", "updated": "2024-03-14T13:03:26Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/zsnes/1.51", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/zsnes/1.51", "licenseUrl": "http://zsnes.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/zsnes/zsnes/docs/license.txt", "packageName": "zsnes", "displayName": "ZSNES", "summary": "SNES emulator written mostly in x86 low-level assembly language", "version": "1.51", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/1b2a037ff918443eddb449949d357e7362020c98/icons/zsnes.png", "author": "ZSNES Team", "downloadCount": 2382, "tags": ["emulator", "snes", "gaming"]}
