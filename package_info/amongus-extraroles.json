For help with installing the mod, getting it to work, or fixing an issue, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/j2MVs4r6cc).\n\n# What does the mod add?\n\n## Medic\nThe Medic can give any player a shield that will make them immortal. Although, if The Medic dies, the shield will break.  \nThe only exception is The Officer; they will still die if they try to kill a Crewmate.  \nThe Medic's other feature shows when they find a corpse: they can get a report that contains clues to the killer's identity.  \nThe type of information they get is based on a timer that can be configured inside the host's config file. \n  \n## Officer\nThe Officer is a class of Crewmate that is allowed to kill people, similar to Impostors.  \nTheir goal is to locate the Impostor and deliver vigilante justice, but if they accidentally shoot a Crewmate, they die instead.  \n  \n## Engineer\nThe Engineer can repair one emergency per game from anywhere on the entire map.  \nThe other ablity of The Engineer is that they are able to use the vents that were previously exclusive to Impostors.  \n\n## Joker\nThe Joker is interesting; they aren't part of the Crewmates **or** Impostors, and they can only win by being falsely convicted as an Impostor.  \nIf The Joker get's voted off the ship, the game will end instantly.  \nThe Joker also has no tasks.  \n\n*Please Note:* This is an automatically updated package.
