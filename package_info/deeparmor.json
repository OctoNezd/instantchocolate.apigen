{"description": "DeepArmor Is a next-generation endpoint protection solution that uses artificial intelligence to block future, unknown variants of malware, offering better protection than any existing traditional antivirus solution. It does not bog down systems with the bloated, system slowing, noisy, and popup-riddled experience associated with traditional free security products.  Is easy to install, easy to manage and configure, updates itself automatically, and protects devices for a set-it-and forget-it security experience.  This is a 15 day free trial.\n\n###Features:\n *Intelligent Threat Prevention: A pioneering antivirus solution uses AI to protect against never before-seen-threats\n *Lightweight Agent: Traditional AV drains processing power, battery life and bombards you with pesky pop-ups\n *Proactive Protection:  DeepArmor doesn\u2019t need constant updates to protect against new threats.  Our AI engine identifies and stops new threats proactively", "updated": "2024-03-21T01:34:08Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/deeparmor/2.0.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/deeparmor/2.0.0", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "deeparmor", "displayName": "DeepArmor Next Generation Antivirus - Trial Edition", "summary": "DeepArmor Next Generation Antivirus - Trial Edition", "version": "2.0.0", "icon": "", "author": "SparkCognition", "downloadCount": 1377, "tags": ["antivirus", "security", "DeepArmor", "SparkCognition", "av", "trial"]}
