{"description": "Emsisoft Anti-Malware is fueled by a dual engine malware scanner for twice the malware cleaning power, with no extra resource requirements.\n\nOn top of that, Emsisoft Anti-Malware can even remove potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) that overload your computer with resource wasting bloat.\n\nAltogether, that guarantees superior detection, efficient removal, and a clean Windows operating system where you\u2019re completely Malware-Free.\n\nBy default Emsisoft Anti-Malware installs as a free fully functional 30 day trial version. After the trial period you can ***either*** choose to buy a full version license ***or switch to the limited freeware mode. The freeware mode still allows you to scan and clean infections, but it doesn't provide any real-time protection to guard against new infections.***\n\n***This is no longer true therefore the package will be discontinued.***\n\n***An alternative can be found here:***\nhttps://chocolatey.org/packages/emsisoft-emergency-kit\n\nEmsisoft Anti-Malware doesn't allow package updates. Whoever comes up with a working uninstall script is welcome to share.", "updated": "2024-03-23T00:33:35Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/emsisoft-anti-malware/11.0.0.5958", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/emsisoft-anti-malware/11.0.0.5958", "licenseUrl": "https://my.emsisoft.com/en_us/eula.html", "packageName": "emsisoft-anti-malware", "displayName": "Emsisoft Anti-Malware", "summary": "Anti-Malware solution from Emsisoft", "version": "11.0.0.5958", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/aronovgj/chocolatey/master/icons/emsisoft-anti-malware.png", "author": "Emsisoft", "downloadCount": 58906, "tags": ["anti-spyware", "anti-malware", "malware-remover", "real-time-protection", "virus"]}
