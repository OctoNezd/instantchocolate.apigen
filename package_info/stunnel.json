{"description": "The **stunnel** program is designed to work as TLS encryption wrapper between remote clients and local (inetd-startable) or remote servers. The concept is that having non-TLS aware daemons running on your system you can easily set them up to communicate with clients over secure TLS channels.\n\n**stunnel** can be used to add TLS functionality to commonly used Inetd daemons like POP-2, POP-3, and IMAP servers, to standalone daemons like NNTP, SMTP and HTTP, and in tunneling PPP over network sockets without changes to the source code.\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [Features](https://www.stunnel.org/features.html)\n* [Documentation](https://www.stunnel.org/docs.html)\n* [HOWTO](https://www.stunnel.org/howto.html)\n* [FAQ](https://www.stunnel.org/faq.html)\n* [Examples](https://www.stunnel.org/examples.html)\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@47267db3b43b349d47c45a43ee56a127042781eb/automatic/stunnel/screenshot.png)\n\n## Notes\n\n* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).\n  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:03:53Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/stunnel/5.72", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/stunnel/5.72", "licenseUrl": "https://www.stunnel.org/COPYING.html", "packageName": "stunnel", "displayName": "stunnel - SSL Encryption Wrapper", "summary": "Add TLS encryption functionality to existing clients and servers without code changes", "version": "5.72", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@6e46bb9db09a6fb51f7c9f7581502b56e3b15533/icons/stunnel.png", "author": "Michal Trojnara", "downloadCount": 382259, "tags": ["security", "ssl", "tls", "cryptography", "internet", "proxy-server", "networking", "stunnel"]}
