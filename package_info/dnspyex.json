{"description": "dnSpy is a debugger and .NET assembly editor. You can use it to edit and debug assemblies even if you don't have any source code available. Main features:\n\n- Debug .NET and Unity assemblies\n- Edit .NET and Unity assemblies\n- Light and dark themes\n\nSee below for more features\n\n![debug-animated](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy/raw/master/images/debug-animated.gif)\n\n![edit-code-animated](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy/raw/master/images/edit-code-animated.gif)\n\n# Debugger\n\n- Debug .NET Framework, .NET and Unity game assemblies, no source code required\n- Set breakpoints and step into any assembly\n- Locals, watch, autos windows\n- Variables windows support saving variables (eg. decrypted byte arrays) to disk or view them in the hex editor (memory window)\n- Object IDs\n- Multiple processes can be debugged at the same time\n- Break on module load\n- Tracepoints and conditional breakpoints\n- Export/import breakpoints and tracepoints\n- Call stack, threads, modules, processes windows\n- Break on thrown exceptions (1st chance)\n- Variables windows support evaluating C# / Visual Basic expressions\n- Dynamic modules can be debugged (but not dynamic methods due to CLR limitations)\n- Output window logs various debugging events, and it shows timestamps by default :)\n- Assemblies that decrypt themselves at runtime can be debugged, dnSpy will use the in-memory image. You can also force dnSpy to always use in-memory images instead of disk files.\n- Public API, you can write an extension or use the C# Interactive window to control the debugger\n\n# Assembly Editor\n\n- All metadata can be edited\n- Edit methods and classes in C# or Visual Basic with IntelliSense, no source code required\n- Add new methods, classes or members in C# or Visual Basic\n- IL editor for low-level IL method body editing\n- Low-level metadata tables can be edited. This uses the hex editor internally.\n\n# Hex Editor\n\n- Click on an address in the decompiled code to go to its IL code in the hex editor\n- The reverse of the above, press F12 in an IL body in the hex editor to go to the decompiled code or other high-level representation of the bits. It's great to find out which statement a patch modified.\n- Highlights .NET metadata structures and PE structures\n- Tooltips show more info about the selected .NET metadata / PE field\n- Go to position, file, RVA\n- Go to .NET metadata token, method body, #Blob / #Strings / #US heap offset or #GUID heap index\n- Follow references (Ctrl+F12)\n\n# Other\n\n- BAML decompiler\n- Blue, light and dark themes (and a dark high contrast theme)\n- Bookmarks\n- C# Interactive window can be used to script dnSpy\n- Search assemblies for classes, methods, strings, etc\n- Analyze class and method usage, find callers, etc\n- Multiple tabs and tab groups\n- References are highlighted, use Tab / Shift+Tab to move to the next reference\n- Go to the entry point and module initializer commands\n- Go to metadata token or metadata row commands\n- Code tooltips (C# and Visual Basic)\n- Export to project\n\n# List of other open source libraries used by dnSpy\n\n- [ILSpy decompiler engine](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) (C# and Visual Basic decompilers)\n- [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) (C# and Visual Basic compilers)\n- [dnlib](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib) (.NET metadata reader/writer which can also read obfuscated assemblies)\n- [VS MEF](https://github.com/microsoft/vs-mef) (Faster MEF equals faster startup)\n- [ClrMD](https://github.com/microsoft/clrmd) (Access to lower level debugging info not provided by the CorDebug API)\n- [Iced](https://github.com/icedland/iced) (x86/x64 disassembler)\n\n# Translating dnSpy\n\n[Click here](https://crowdin.com/project/dnspy) if you want to help with translating dnSpy to your native language.\n\n# [Credits](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy/blob/master/dnSpy/dnSpy/LicenseInfo/CREDITS.txt)", "updated": "2024-03-23T11:33:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dnspyex/6.4.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/dnspyex/6.4.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy/blob/master/dnSpy/dnSpy/LicenseInfo/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "dnspyex", "displayName": "dnSpyEx", "summary": ".NET assembly editor, decompiler, and debugger", "version": "6.4.1", "icon": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/sitiom/chocolatey-packages/main/icons/dnspyex.png", "author": "0xd4d,  ElektroKill", "downloadCount": 20413, "tags": ["dnspy", "dnspyex", "assembly", "cil", "debugger", "decompiler", "dnlib", "dotnet", "editor", "il", "ilspy", "msil", "net", ".net"]}
