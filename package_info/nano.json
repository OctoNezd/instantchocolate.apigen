{"description": "## nano\nNano is ANOther editor.  The nano project was started because of a few \"problems\" with the wonderfully easy-to-use and friendly Pico text editor.\n\nFirst and foremost was its license: the Pine suite does not use the GPL or a GPL-friendly license, and has unclear restrictions on\nredistribution.  Because of this, Pine and Pico are not included with many GNU/Linux distributions.  Also, other features (like go-to-line-number or search-and-replace) were unavailable until recently or require a command-line flag.  Yuck.\n\nnano aims to solve these problems by emulating the functionality of Pico as closely as possible while addressing the problems above and providing other extra functionality.\n\n* [Screenshots](https://www.nano-editor.org/screenshots.php)\n* [FAQ](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/faq.html)\n* [Manual](https://www.nano-editor.org/docs.php)\n\n#### Mailing lists\n* [Info-nano](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/info-nano) - announcements\n* [Help-nano](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-nano) - help", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:48:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/nano/7.2.36", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/nano/7.2.36", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/lhmouse/nano-win/blob/master/COPYING", "packageName": "nano", "displayName": "GNU nano", "summary": "Free replacement for the Pico text editor, while possibly adding new features", "version": "7.2.36", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@ec9700d9c083614a05a4c771f5ec93d188168d8f/icons/nano.svg", "author": "Chris Allegretta", "downloadCount": 260644, "tags": ["gnu", "text", "editor"]}
