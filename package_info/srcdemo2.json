{"description": "Utility to render high-quality, smooth Source Engine movies using a customized userspace filesystem that catches the frames before they are written to disk. Can render your movie at a framerate as high as you want it to be, yet keep disk usage flat. Adds a nice motion blur effect to the video. Also includes shutter angle simulation.\n\nCan be used with any Source engine game with Source Recorder, which includes: * Team Fortress 2 * Team Fortress 2 Beta * Portal * Portal 2 * Counter-Strike Source * Any mod of the above games * Future Valve titles, possibly * Works with Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, but those two games use a glitchy version of the Source engine, which causes severe graphical issues (zombies teleporting all over the place) when rendering at high framerates\n\nRelies on the Dokan library.", "updated": "2024-03-20T07:48:37Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/srcdemo2/2012.04.07", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/srcdemo2/2012.04.07", "licenseUrl": "https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause", "packageName": "srcdemo2", "displayName": "SrcDemo\u00b2 (Install)", "summary": "Utility to render high-quality, smooth Source Engine movies using a customized userspace filesystem that catches the frames before they are written to disk", "version": "2012.04.07", "icon": "https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive/v2/code.google.com/srcdemo2/logo.png", "author": "Etienne Perot", "downloadCount": 3319, "tags": ["srcdemo2", "srcdemo", "valve", "source", "steam", "tf", "team-fortress", "tf2", "team-fortress2", "portal", "portal2", "css", "counter-strike", "cs", "dokan", "fs", "vfs", "filesystem", "admin"]}
