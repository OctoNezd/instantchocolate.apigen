{"description": "Sengi is a **Mastodon** and **Pleroma** desktop focused client. It takes inspiration from the old Tweetdeck [client](https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/muo-tweetdeck2b.png), the new Tweetdeck webapp and Mastodon UI.\n\nIt is strongly focused on the following points:\n\n-   Heavily oriented on multi-accounts usage\n-   Desktop based interactions (right click, left click, etc)\n-   One column at a time display (leave it on the side of your screen, and keep an eye on it while doing your other stuff)\n\nIt is released as a **browser webapp** and also packaged as an **cross-platform desktop application** (Mac, Windows, and Linux).\n\n**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-23T00:18:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sengi/1.8.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/sengi/1.8.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/NicolasConstant/sengi-electron/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "sengi", "displayName": "Sengi", "summary": "A FLOSS multi-account Mastodon and Pleroma desktop client.", "version": "1.8.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/NicolasConstant/sengi-electron@master/assets/icons/png/1024x1024.png", "author": "Nicolas Constant (and contributors)", "downloadCount": 620, "tags": ["sengi", "mastodon", "pleroma", "desktop", "client"]}
