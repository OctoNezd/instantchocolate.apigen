{"description": "In Visual Studio 2008 and earlier versions, a line paste retains the caret's current column location. Visual Studio 2010 moves the caret to the start of the line, which is very frustrating. This extension fixes the bug, which has been reported here: https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/572326/line-copy-paste-bug\n\nVisual Studio 2012 does a better job but it still requires this extension to fix all the cases.", "updated": "2024-03-03T02:03:21Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/visualstudio-linepastefix/7.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/visualstudio-linepastefix/7.0", "licenseUrl": "https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0bed93d6-2d4b-4661-a426-7071a2b386e7", "packageName": "visualstudio-linepastefix", "displayName": "Line Paste Fix for Visual Studio", "summary": "In VS2010 and above when you paste a line copy, the caret goes to the beginning of the line.
