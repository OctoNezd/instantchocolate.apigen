His tame pet haggis was already contentedly asleep at the foot of the bed dreaming of faraway Scottish Glens, Laird Hamish McTavisch plimped up his pillow, blew out his candle, and fell into a deep sleep. \nOutside the walls glinstened with lighting as a storm settled down for the night over Drumtrochie castle. A barn Owl hooted miserably and, somewhere in the distance, a click struck twelve. \nThroughout the castle came the sound of ancient clicking into operation. This was the ghost expelling machinery invented by the late Red Lair McTavisch was more than a touch peeved having become a ghost himself, to find himself kicked out of his own home by the machinery he invented! It was this machinery that ensured that the McTavish Clan had a long and happy night's sleep. \nWell Until Tonight That Is... \nIt is not easy being a ghost, the hours are long, the place of work cold and dark, and the promotion prospects, in all honesty, are fairly limited. However, the major problem for a prospective ghost is training. \nAlthough the qualifications to become a ghost are fairly simply (being dead is usually the only requirement), the actual haunting part is alot more tricky than most people realise. \nSo, the famous school for Spectres and Spooks was set up, to educate and inform prospective ghost prospective ghost in the ways of haunting. At the end of the school year, the star pupils are sent to haunt there pupils are to haunt the more exclusive nightspots. And so it was Blinky, the school's star pupil, arrived at Drumtrochie Castle ready to put in a solid night's haunting totally unaware of the deadly machinery ticking quietly in the bowels of the Castle. \nThe Gameplay of Blinky's Scary School \nBlinky's Scary school allows the player to control the loveable ghost with eyelid flutter using the cursor keys and space key.

Move over the cauldron to add it to the pot.\nBlinky moves quickly through the maze of rooms in Drumtrochie Castle on the look out for various artifacts that will help him to put the spooks up Laird Hamish McTavish. Find the the hidden clock to wake him up.\nBut beware!
