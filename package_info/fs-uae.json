{"description": "# FS-UAE\n\nFS-UAE is an Amiga emulator for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X based on\nUAE/WinUAE, with a focus on emulating games.\n\nFeatures include emulation of Amiga 500, 1200, 4000, CD32 and CDTV,\nperfectly smooth scrolling on 50Hz displays, support for floppy images in\nADF and IPF formats, CD-ROM images in ISO or BIN/CUE format, mounting folders\non your computer as Amiga hard drives, support for Picasso 96 drivers for\nhigh-color and high-resolution Workbench displays, and more...\n\nA unique feature is support for cross-platform online play. You can now play\nAmiga games against (or with) friends over the Internet.\n\nThe emulator uses the latest Amiga emulation code from the WinUAE project\nand requires a moderately fast computer with accelerated graphics (OpenGL)\nto work. A game pad or joystick is recommended, but not required (FS-UAE\ncan emulate a joystick using the cursor keys and right ctrl/alt keys).\n\nThe official home page of FS-UAE is https://fs-uae.net/\n\n## Important Information\n\nFS-UAE itself does not include a configuration UI, so you must either:\n\n- Run FS-UAE via the configuration program [FS-UAE Launcher](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/fs-uae-launcher/).\n- Create a configuration file before the emulator will be usable.\n- Run FS-UAE from a third-party configuration interface / frontend.\n\n## Maintainer's Note\n\nI produce and maintain Chocolatey packages in my spare time, for free.
