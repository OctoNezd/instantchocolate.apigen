{"description": "## Run OpenShift locally\n\nMinishift is a tool that helps you run OpenShift locally by running a single-node OpenShift cluster inside a VM. You can try out OpenShift or develop with it, day-to-day, on your local host.\n\nMinishift uses libmachine for provisioning VMs, and OpenShift Origin for running the cluster. The code base is forked from the Minikube project.\n\n#### Note: Windows support is limited to 64bit systems.", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:33:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/minishift/1.34.3", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/minishift/1.34.3", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/minishift/minishift/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "minishift", "displayName": "Minishift: Run OpenShift locally", "summary": "Minishift is a tool that helps you run OpenShift locally.", "version": "1.34.3", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-coreteampackages@d2ba3846157215dd14199887818129eea17950eb/icons/minishift.png", "author": "RedHat,  Minishift contributors", "downloadCount": 21673, "tags": ["openshift", "kubernetes", "docker", "rkt", "containers", "devops", "development", "cli", "foss"]}
