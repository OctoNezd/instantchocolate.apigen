{"description": "The Vagrant VMware Utility is a system installer package and is required by the Vagrant VMware Desktop plugin for proper functionality. This system installer provides a small utility service that Vagrant utilizes for interacting with VMware on the system.\n\nIsolating the features which require privileged access into a system installer package provides an easier and more secure installation. Isolating privileged activities to the Vagrant VMware Utility also means that only one privileged installation action must be taken on a system. After the package is installed, any user on the system can be allowed to interact with the utility without the need for privilege escalation.", "updated": "2024-03-22T22:48:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vagrant-vmware-utility/1.0.22", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/vagrant-vmware-utility/1.0.22", "licenseUrl": "https://www.vagrantup.com/vmware/eula.html", "packageName": "vagrant-vmware-utility", "displayName": "Vagrant VMware Utility", "summary": "The Vagrant VMware Utility is a system installer package and is required by the Vagrant VMware Desktop plugin for proper functionality.", "version": "1.0.22", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages/269d34200380fe4fded0508b85e341e1c055cd85/icons/vagrant.png", "author": "HashiCorp", "downloadCount": 7003, "tags": ["Vagrant", "VMware", "Workstation"]}
