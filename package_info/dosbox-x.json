{"description": "DOSBox-X is a cross-platform DOS emulator based on the DOSBox project (https://www.dosbox.com)\n\nLike DOSBox, it emulates a PC necessary for running many MS-DOS games and applications that simply cannot be run on modern PCs and operating systems. However, while the main focus of DOSBox is for running DOS games, DOSBox-X goes much further than this. Started as a fork of the DOSBox project, it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for. But it is also a platform for running DOS applications, including emulating the environments to run Windows 3.x, 9x and ME and software written for those versions of Windows.", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:48:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dosbox-x/2024.03.01", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/dosbox-x/2024.03.01", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/blob/dosbox-x-v0.83.3/COPYING", "packageName": "dosbox-x", "displayName": "Dosbox-x", "summary": "DOSBox-X fork of the DOSBox project.", "version": "2024.03.01", "icon": "", "author": "Jonathan Campbell", "downloadCount": 5984, "tags": ["dosbox", "dosbox-x", "dos", "emulator"]}
