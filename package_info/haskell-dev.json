{"description": "This is an opinionated automated environment for performing Haskell development on windows\n        using GHC and Cabal along with MSYS2.  The goal of the project is to create as minimal of\n        indirections between you and the tools as possible in order to simplify things and make\n        things easier to understand and debug.  The core premise of the project is to integrate into\n        Windows and not box off or isolate Haskell tools from other tools while using no or as few\n        global state as possible.\n\n        This package will automatically configure msys2 for use by cabal.  If you already have msys2\n        install then nothing else needs to be done. Otherwise msys2 will be installed for you.\n\n        Lastly in order to facilitate package installations a new CmdLet `mingw64-pkg` is created to make it easier to install\n        native dependencies such as `gtk`.\n\n            C:\\PS> mingw-pkg install gtk2\n\n        This CmdLet makes it easier to install native Mingw-w64 packages into MSYS2 such\n        that cabal-install and GHC can use them without any other configuration required.\n\n        This will not allow installation of MSYS2 packages.  Your global namespace will\n        not be poluted by the use of this CmdLet.\n\n        The action to perform. Must be one of install, uninstall, update or shell.\n\n        - install: install a new native package\n        - uninstall: remove native package\n        - update: sync the repositories, will not upgrade any packages.\n        - shell: open a bash shell\n\n        An optional last parameter can be used to force a prompt before installing a package.\n        Default is off.\n\n            C:\\PS> mingw-pkg install gtk2 $true\n\n        For AppVeyor use we recommend installing the ghc and cabal packages directly as to not install msys2 twice.\n        You will still have access to mingw-pkg.", "updated": "2024-03-24T00:48:33Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/haskell-dev/0.0.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/haskell-dev/0.0.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/Mistuke/HaskellDevChoco/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "haskell-dev", "displayName": "Haskell Development Environment", "summary": "Complete Haskell development environment using Cabal.", "version": "0.0.1", "icon": "https://mistuke.blob.core.windows.net/binaries/haskell-dev/haskell-dev.png", "author": "Tamar Christina", "downloadCount": 150583, "tags": ["cabal", "ghc", "haskell"]}
