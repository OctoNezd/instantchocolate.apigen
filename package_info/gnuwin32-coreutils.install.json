{"description": "The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation utilities of the GNU operating system.\nThese are the core utilities which are expected to exist on every operating system.\n\nSource, pre-built binaries, installers and md5 signatures are available as [gnuwin32 sourceforge files](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/coreutils/5.3.0/). They are presented through this nuget package without modification.\n\nAdditional information about the coreutils package can be found on the [coreutils homepage](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/).\n\nBased on the text of the [coreutils FAQ](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/faq/coreutils-faq.html) and this version's release date and source copyrights asserted in 2004 and 2005, copyright is attributed to FSF which at that time required new attributions to be assigned to FSF. A cursory search through the source finds that individual author copyright text is asserted in the source tree between 1984-2005.\n\nCredit also unknown authors, since the AUTHORS file in source does not list every contributor for each utility, and the maintainer of the gnuwin32 tools.", "updated": "2024-03-24T01:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gnuwin32-coreutils.install/5.3.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/gnuwin32-coreutils.install/5.3.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "packageName": "gnuwin32-coreutils.install", "displayName": "GnuWin32 CoreUtils for Windows (Install)", "summary": "GNU core utilities", "version": "5.3.0", "icon": "http://cdn.rawgit.com/epu/epu-choco-pkg/master/gnuwin32-coreutils.install/icons/gnu.png", "author": "Arnold Robbins, Colin Plumb, David M.
