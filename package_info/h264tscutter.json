{"description": "**NOTE:** This package is no longer supported by application creator, and therefore no longer available.\n\nYou can cut HDTV-Transportstreams (AVC / H.264) with the H264TS_Cutter. The source material won't be encoded, so you can only cut on I-Frames (the program will look for it by itself). If you want to use the video playback function, a ts-splitter and an avc-codec have to be installed. Requires .Net Framework 2.0.\n\n### Note\n\nDownload link on official site does not work.
