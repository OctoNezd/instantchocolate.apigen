{"description": "This tool allows users of Shoot clusters operated by [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/) to access their clusters as cluster-admin using dynamically generated short-living credentials.\n      `gardenlogin`s `get-client-certificate` command can be used as a `kubectl` [credential plugin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#client-go-credential-plugins). It fetches the `cluster-admin` credentials from the API introduced with [GEP-16](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/proposals/16-adminkubeconfig-subresource.md). See more details under [Authentication Flow](#authentication-flow) \n      With GEP-16, users are able to generate kubeconfigs for `Shoot` clusters with short-lived certificates, to access the cluster as `cluster-admin`.", "updated": "2024-03-22T11:18:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gardenlogin/0.5.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/gardenlogin/0.5.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/gardener/gardenlogin/blob/master/LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt", "packageName": "gardenlogin", "displayName": "gardenlogin (Install)", "summary": "gardenlogin get-client-certificate command can be used as a kubectl credential plugin", "version": "0.5.1", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/gardener/gardener/v1.38.0/logo/gardener-large.png", "author": "SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company and Gardener contributors", "downloadCount": 593, "tags": ["gardenlogin"]}
