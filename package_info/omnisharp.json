{"description": "[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/omnisharp/Builds/_apis/build/status/OmniSharp.omnisharp-roslyn?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/omnisharp/Builds/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master)\n\n## Introduction\n\nOmniSharp is a .NET development platform based on [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) workspaces. It provides project dependencies and C# language services to various IDEs and plugins.\n\nOmniSharp is built with the [.NET Core SDK](https://dot.net/) on Windows and [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) on OSX/Linux. It targets the _net472_ target framework. For platforms other than Windows, OmniSharp ships with an _embedded Mono_ which is based on version _5.18.0_, includes MSBuild _16.3.0_ and is provisioned during the build script. If _Mono_ is globally installed on the system, OmniSharp will prefer it over the embedded version, however version _>=6.4.0_ is required (the lowest version with at least MSBuild _16.3.0_).\n\n### Configuration\n\nOmniSharp provides a rich set of hierarchical configuration options, controlled via startup arguments, environment variables and `omnisharp.json` file. For more details please visit the [Configuration Options](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/wiki/Configuration-Options) section of the wiki.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright \u00a9 .NET Foundation, and contributors.\n\nOmniSharp is provided as-is under the MIT license.
