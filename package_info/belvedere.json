{"description": "Belvedere sets up rules for taking actions on files (move, copy, delete, etc) based on the name of a file, its extension, size, age, and more.\n\nBelvedere is a Windows knock-off of the Mac-only Hazel, and Gina has already guided you through setting up a self-cleaning Mac with Hazel, so for a few good ideas for how you might get started with Belvedere, check out her guide. Belvedere's not quite up to par with Hazel yet, but in time I'm hoping to implement as many of Hazel's features as I can for Windows users.\n\n[How-to Guide](http://lifehacker.com/5510961/how-to-automatically-clean-and-organize-your-desktop-downloads-and-other-folders)\n[Source code](https://github.com/mshorts/belvedere)", "updated": "2024-03-22T22:48:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/belvedere/0.7.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/belvedere/0.7.1", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/mshorts/belvedere/blob/master/LICENSE.txt", "packageName": "belvedere", "displayName": "Belvedere", "summary": "Automated file manager", "version": "0.7.1", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/9856ff4757b8ace9a7b612e953b068bbe21b211c/icons/belvedere.png", "author": "Adam Pash, Matt Shorts", "downloadCount": 1628, "tags": ["automation", "file-management", "organizer", "clean", "move", "sort"]}
