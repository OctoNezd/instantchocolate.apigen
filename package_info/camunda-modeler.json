{"description": "Camunda Modeler is a desktop application for editing BPMN process diagrams and DMN decision tables. It is very easy to use, which means that business analysts can use it as well as developers, working on the same diagrams.\n\nBesides the visual modeling, Camunda Modeler also allows you to edit all properties that are necessary for the technical execution. Since Camunda Modeler works directly on the BPMN and DMN XML files, developers can easily combine it with their preferred IDE (for example Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelliJ).\n\nCamunda Modeler leverages bpmn.io, which is probably the most awesome modeling framework in the known universe.", "updated": "2024-03-21T18:03:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/camunda-modeler/5.15.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/camunda-modeler/5.15.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "camunda-modeler", "displayName": "Camunda Modeler", "summary": "BPMN process diagrams and DMN decision tables", "version": "5.15.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/staylorx/chocolatey_camunda-modeler@master/camunda_modeler-icon.png", "author": "https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler/graphs/contributors", "downloadCount": 11779, "tags": ["camunda", "bpmn", "modeler"]}
