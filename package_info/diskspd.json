{"description": "DiskSpd is a highly customizable I/O load generator tool that can be used to run storage performance tests against files, partitions, or physical disks. DiskSpd can generate a wide variety of disk request patterns for use in analyzing and diagnosing storage performance issues, without running a full end-to-end workload. You can simulate SQL Server I/O activity or more complex, changing access patterns, returning detailed XML output for use in automated results analysis.\n\nSelect highlights include:\n- Ability to target physical disks in addition to partitions and files\n- Variable read/write IO percentage settings\n- Custom CPU affinity options\n- Consumable XML output option\n- Synchronization and tracing functionality\n\nFor a few basic usage examples, see the [DiskSpd page on the TechNet Gallery](http://aka.ms/diskspd).\nThe full documentation is available as a [wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/diskspd/wiki).", "updated": "2024-03-22T06:48:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/diskspd/2.1.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/diskspd/2.1.0", "licenseUrl": "http://aka.ms/diskspd", "packageName": "diskspd", "displayName": "The DiskSpd Storage Performance Tool", "summary": "DiskSpd is a storage load generator / performance test tool from the Microsoft Windows, Windows Server and Cloud Server Infrastructure Engineering teams.", "version": "2.1.0", "icon": "", "author": "Microsoft", "downloadCount": 7851, "tags": ["diskspd", "storage", "test", "performance", "benchmark", "load", "generator", "iops", "sqliosim", "sqlio", "sql", "server"]}
