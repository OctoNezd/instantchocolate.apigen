{"description": "GNU Emacs.\n\nAn extensible, customizable, free / libre text editor - and more.\n\nAt its core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language with extensions to support text editing.\n\nThe features of GNU Emacs include:\n\n  * Content-aware editing modes, including syntax coloring, for many file types.\n  * Complete built-in documentation, including a tutorial for new users.\n  * Full Unicode support for nearly all human scripts.\n  * Highly customizable, using Emacs Lisp code or a graphical interface.\n  * A wide range of functionality beyond text editing, including a project planner, mail and news reader, debugger interface, calendar, IRC client, and more.\n  * A packaging system for downloading and installing extensions.\n\n**NOTE**: This is the `.portable` version of Emacs. Unlike previous versions this will unpack the files to the `$env:ChocolateyToolsLocation\\emacs` folder (usually c:\\tools\\emacs).\n\n**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-23T23:18:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/emacs.portable/29.2.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/emacs.portable/29.2.0", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Copying.html", "packageName": "emacs.portable", "displayName": "Emacs (Portable)", "summary": "GNU Emacs - An extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor - and more.", "version": "29.2.0", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pauby/ChocoPackages@c120885/icons/emacs.png", "author": "The GNU Project", "downloadCount": 23924, "tags": ["emacs", "editor"]}
