{"description": "## KeePass Quick Unlock\nKeePass Quick Unlock is a plug-in for KeePass 2.x which lets you re-open your database without your full \npassword. If you want to re-open your database, you can type just a few characters (by default, the \nfirst 3 characters of your password) to unlock quickly and easily! If the wrong QuickUnlock key is \nentered, the database keeps locked and the full password is required to re-open.\n\nThis plugin doesn't change the way how KeePass encrypts your database so your passwords are still safe.\nFor more informations why this plugin doesn't break safety, \nread http://keepass.info/help/base/security.html#secspecattacks\n\n![Screenshot of QuickUnlock](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2d39f8afe4b7d739ebbb4c49b23e1240ecfcd9c0/68747470733a2f2f61626c6f61642e64652f696d672f717569636b756e6c6f636b31316e7564302e6a7067)\n\n### Package-specific issue\nIf this package isn't up-to-date for some days, [Create an issue](https://github.com/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages/issues/new/choose)\n\n[![Patreon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@d15c4e19c709e7148588d4523ffc6dd3cd3c7e5e/icons/patreon.png)](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=39585820)", "updated": "2024-03-23T22:18:48Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/keepass-plugin-quickunlock/2.4", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/keepass-plugin-quickunlock/2.4", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/KN4CK3R/KeePassQuickUnlock/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "keepass-plugin-quickunlock", "displayName": "KeePass Plugin QuickUnlock", "summary": "Plugin for KeePass 2.x to quickly unlock an open database", "version": "2.4", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@91530e19f0ceb051c571dd40fd417629f1059832/icons/keepass-plugin-quickunlock.png", "author": "KN4CK3R", "downloadCount": 1669, "tags": ["foss", "keepass", "plugin", "password", "unlock"]}
