{"description": "The Tor software protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location, and it lets you access sites which are blocked.\n\nTor Browser lets you use Tor on Microsoft Windows, macOS, or GNU/Linux without needing to install any software. It can run off a USB flash drive, comes with a pre-configured web browser to protect your anonymity, and is self-contained (portable).\n\n## Notes\n\n* This package only installs the English (en-US) version of Tor Browser.\n* In some countries the Tor Project website is blocked or censored and it is not possible to download Tor Browser directly.", "updated": "2024-03-23T21:33:37Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/tor-browser-dev/13.5.5", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/tor-browser-dev/13.5.5", "licenseUrl": "https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#DistributingTor", "packageName": "tor-browser-dev", "displayName": "Tor Browser (alpha)", "summary": "Tor Browser lets you use Tor without needing to install any software.
