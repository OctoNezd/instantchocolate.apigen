We have no access to your files. All transmission over the network is through SSL/TLS.\n\n### Totally transparent\nYour backups are stored in an open, documented format. We've published an open-source command-line utility so you can see\nfor yourself your backups and directly restore your files from cloud storage. Other users have also contributed\nArq-compatible utilities like arqinator.\n\n### Awesome Support\nWe're obsessive about getting solutions to customers' problems, so we strive to fix issues in Arq quickly. We often\ndeliver patches within days or even hours of first report of a software problem.\n\n### Native apps\nBoth Arq for Mac and Arq for Windows are native apps built for maximum device fidelity and maximum performance.\nNo Java means no Java-related upgrade headaches or performance problems.\n\n### Efficient\nArq does all it can to minimize uploads: Compression reduces upload sizes. Client-side de-duplication ensures Arq\nnever uploads the same content twice. Rsync-style \"rolling checksum\" ensures only the changed parts of files are uploaded.\n\n### Cloud Choice\nYou can back up to your own Amazon Cloud Drive, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Storage, Google Drive, Dropbox,\nor OneDrive accounts, or your SFTP server or NAS. Use that extra space in your existing cloud account to store your\nencrypted backups.\n\n### Unlimited in every way\n* Arq backs up everything or just the files you choose.\n* Arq doesn't skip videos or ignore certain file types\n* Arq backs up files of any size -- 4GB, 40GB, it doesn't matter\n* Arq backs up your external drives\n* Arq backs up your network drives\n* Arq doesn't delete backups of your external drives just because you haven't plugged them in lately\n* Arq doesn't forcibly delete old backup records (unless you tell it to).\n* Arq restores your files onto any computer.\n\n#### System Requirements - Windows: Windows 7 or later, with .NET 4.5.1 or later\n\n#### 30-day free trial. $49.99 to purchase v5 or $79.98 for lifetime upgrades.\n\n**SOCIAL MEDIA:**\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/arqbackup) | [Blog](https://www.arqbackup.com/blog/)\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/arq/readme.md)**\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Click here to [Patreon-ize](https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3) the package maintainer.**\n\n---", "updated": "2024-03-23T19:48:28Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/arq/7.24.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/arq/7.24.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.arqbackup.com/documentation/pages/license.html", "packageName": "arq", "displayName": "Arq (Trial) (Install)", "summary": "Back up your files automatically to the cloud", "version": "7.24.0", "icon": "https://www.arqbackup.com/images/ArqIcons/icon_512x512.png", "author": "Haystack Software LLC", "downloadCount": 14309, "tags": ["arq", "backup", "cloud", "amazon", "google", "dropbox", "onedrive", "sftp", "nas", "trial"]}
