{"description": "GNU Solfege is an ear training program written to help you train intervals, chords, scales and rhythms. It is free software and part of the GNU Project. The program is indented to help music students with their ear training.\n\nThe program runs on GNU Linux and similar operating systems that have Python and the Gtk+ toolkit available, and on Windows XP/Vista/7/8. People with some hacker skills can make it run on Mac OS X, but that is not easy. There is no planned port to Android, Symbian or iOS. The reason for this is that Solfege is written in Python and Gtk+, and porting to those operating systems require that I rewrite the program in another programming language.", "updated": "2024-03-23T14:18:27Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/solfege/3.22.2.1", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/solfege/3.22.2.1", "licenseUrl": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html", "packageName": "solfege", "displayName": "GNU Solfege", "summary": "GNU Solfege is an ear training program written to help you train intervals, chords, scales and rhythms.
