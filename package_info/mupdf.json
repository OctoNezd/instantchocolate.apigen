{"description": "MuPDF is a lightweight PDF, XPS, and E-book viewer.\n\nMuPDF consists of a software library, command line tools, and viewers for various platforms.\n\nThe renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased graphics. It renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within fractions of a pixel for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of a printed page on screen.\n\nThe viewer is small, fast, yet complete. It supports many document formats, such as PDF, XPS, OpenXPS, CBZ, EPUB, and FictionBook 2. You can annotate PDF documents and fill out forms with the mobile viewers (this feature is coming soon to the desktop viewer as well).\n\nThe command line tools allow you to annotate, edit, and convert documents to other formats such as HTML, SVG, PDF, and CBZ. You can also write scripts to manipulate documents using Javascript.", "updated": "2024-03-23T17:18:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/mupdf/1.23.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/mupdf/1.23.0", "licenseUrl": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt", "packageName": "mupdf", "displayName": "MuPDF", "summary": "MuPDF is a lightweight PDF, XPS, and E-book viewer.", "version": "1.23.0", "icon": "https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=mupdf.git;a=blob_plain;f=docs/logo/mupdf-icon.png;hb=HEAD", "author": "Artifex Software", "downloadCount": 11693, "tags": ["mupdf", "pdf", "xps", "ebook", "epub", "reader", "viewer", "AGPL", "embedded"]}
