{"description": "LAStools is a collection of highly efficient, batch-scriptable, multicore command line tools. It includes tools to classify, tile, convert, filter, raster, triangulate, contour, clip, and polygonize LiDAR data (to name just a few functions). All of the tools can also be run via a native GUI and are available as a LiDAR processing toolboxes for [ArcGIS](https://arcgis.com) versions 9.3, 10.0, 10.1, 10.2, or 10.3, for [QGIS](https://chocolatey.org/packages/QGIS) versions 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, or 2.10, and for [ERDAS IMAGINE](http://www.hexagongeospatial.com/products/producer-suite/erdas-imagine) versions 14.0 and 15.1.\n\nLAStools is the fastest and most memory efficient solution for batch-scripted multi-core LiDAR processing and can turn billions of LiDAR points into useful products at blazing speeds and with low memory requirements. \n\nIncluded in LAStools is the open-source LiDAR compressor, LASzip, which is the de facto industry standard for compressed LiDAR. \n\n#### [License note](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~isenburg/lastools/LICENSE.txt)\nThere are TWO parts to LAStools. One part is OPEN source (LGPL 2.1). The other part is CLOSED source and requires licensing for most commercial or government use.
