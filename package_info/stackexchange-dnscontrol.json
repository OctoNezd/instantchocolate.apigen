{"description": "DNSControl is a system for maintaining DNS zones. It has two parts: a domain specific language (DSL) for describing DNS zones plus software that processes the DSL and pushes the resulting zones to DNS providers such as Route53, Cloudflare, and Gandi. It can send the same DNS records to multiple providers. It even generates the most beautiful BIND zone files ever. It runs anywhere Go runs (Linux, macOS, Windows). The provider model is extensible, so more providers can be added.", "updated": "2024-03-22T08:18:40Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/stackexchange-dnscontrol/3.20.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/stackexchange-dnscontrol/3.20.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "stackexchange-dnscontrol", "displayName": "dnscontrol", "summary": "Synchronize your DNS to multiple providers from a simple DSL", "version": "3.20.0", "icon": "", "author": "StackExchange Developers", "downloadCount": 1760, "tags": ["dnscontrol", "automated", "dns", "management"]}
