{"description": "A small and very fast portable launcher and updater for Chromium.\n\n### This package:\n* installs chrlauncher, not Chromium.  \n* will set chrlauncher to download/install/update Chromium without the need for admin rights.\n* by default, sets the install location for Chromium to be the per-user, %APPDATA% directory.  Use the `/Shared` package parameter (below) to make the Chromium install location be in the chrlauncher directory and have Chromium (and all its settings) shared among all users.\n\n#### Note\nOther (system-wide) chrlauncher settings can be modified in the `chrlauncher.ini` file located in the same directory as the target of the Chromium Launcher desktop shortcut.  Some options include:\n\n* Auto download updates\n* Show a chrlauncher window when updating (default is a tray icon only)\n* Type of Chromium build\n* Update check period\n\n#### Package Parameters\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n* `/KeepSettings`  - Maintain all settings from an existing, previous version, package installation. (No check for compatibility.)\n* `/Default`  - Make chrlauncher the default \"browser\".  This option requires installing with admin rights.\n* `/Shared`  - Share the Chromium install among all users. \n* `/Type:`_<build>_  - Set chrlauncher to use a specific Chromium build:\n    * dev-official - [official development builds from snapshots repository](commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html)\n    * dev-codecs-sync - (default) [unofficial development builds with codecs](github.com/henrypp/chromium/releases)\n    * stable-codecs-sync - [unofficial stable builds with codecs](github.com/henrypp/chromium/releases)\n    * dev-codecs-nosync - [unofficial development builds with codecs and without google services](github.com/henrypp/chromium/releases)\n    * stable-codecs-nosync - [unofficial stable builds with codecs and without google services](github.com/henrypp/chromium/releases)\n    * ungoogled-chromium - [unofficial builds without google integration and enhanced privacy](github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium)\n\n(Adjust the `chrlauncher.ini` file to manually change the build after installation)\n\nThese parameters can be passed to the installer with the use of `-params`.\nFor example: \n  `choco install chrlauncher.portable -params '\"/Default /KeepSettings\"'`\n  `choco install chrlauncher.portable -params '\"/Type:stable-codecs-sync\"'`", "updated": "2024-03-21T10:48:29Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chrlauncher.portable/2.6", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/chrlauncher.portable/2.6", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/henrypp/chrlauncher/blob/master/LICENSE", "packageName": "chrlauncher.portable", "displayName": "chrlauncher (portable)", "summary": "Small and very fast portable launcher and updater for Chromium.", "version": "2.6", "icon": "https://cdn.rawgit.com/teknowledgist/Chocolatey-packages/master/Icons/chrlauncher_icon.png", "author": "Henry++", "downloadCount": 6859, "tags": ["chrlauncher", "chromium", "chrome", "updater", "portable", "embedded"]}
