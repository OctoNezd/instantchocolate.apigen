{"description": "nginx [engine x] is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server, originally written by Igor Sysoev.\nThis package provides an `nssm` Windows service wrapper for it which creates a standard Windows\nservice named `nginx` to manage the server.\n\n#### N!B! This repository lists both nginx versions - stable and mainline:\n\n* **Stable** and **mainline** only differ by version numbers. On command `choco install nginx-service` the stable will be installed. To access mainline version, you must use pre-release `--pre` switch or specify exact version number, which has `-mainline` appended to it.\n* **Mainline** version might contain more edge features, whereas **stable** will be more prone to bugs. Both versions should receive critical security fixes. If you use this package for development and need to access latest features, go for mainline. If deployment is for longterm and unattended stability - choose stable.\n* More info on [different nginx versions](https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-1-6-1-7-released/)\n\nDuring installation `nginx-service` will create following directory structure:\n```\nC:/tools/nginx/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 conf\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 nginx.original.conf {conf file shipped with official .zip}\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 nginx.conf          {tailored version of above file}\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 conf.d\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 server.default.conf\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 html\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.html\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 logs\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 {Required}\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 temp\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 {Required}\n```\n\n* Place your custom config files inside `conf.d`\n* Conf to be included must follow naming pattern `server*.conf` where `*` is a wildcard\n* Above allows config pattern where extra `.conf` files are included (and reused) manually from `server*.conf`, i.e. PHP location directive\n* It is safe to edit/rename/remove default config files. They will be restored during upgrade only if `conf.d` is empty\n\nAfterwards, you can start and stop the service with following commands: `nssm start nginx-service` and `nssm stop nginx-service`\nOn default, the service will autostart with Windows. To disable this use Services GUI console.\n\nSee the [nginx.org](https://nginx.org) for more detailed documentation.", "updated": "2024-03-22T14:18:30Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/nginx-service/1.24.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/nginx-service/1.24.0", "licenseUrl": "http://nginx.org/LICENSE", "packageName": "nginx-service", "displayName": "nginx service", "summary": "Awesome web server for Windows", "version": "1.24.0", "icon": "http://cdn.rawgit.com/Pilskalns/choco-au-packages/master/nginx-service/nginx-service.png", "author": "Igor Sysoev", "downloadCount": 17213, "tags": ["nginx", "service", "nssm"]}
