{"description": "WinObj is a must-have tool if you are a system administrator concerned about security, a developer tracking down\nobject-related problems, or just curious about the Object Manager namespace.\n\nWinObj is a 32-bit Windows NT program that uses the native Windows NT API (provided by NTDLL.DLL) to access and display\ninformation on the NT Object Manager's name space. Winobj may seem similar to the Microsoft SDK's program of the same\nname, but the SDK version suffers from numerous significant bugs that prevent it from displaying accurate information\n(e.g. its handle and reference counting information are totally broken). In addition, our WinObj understands many more\nobject types. Finally, Version 2.0 of our WinObj has user-interface enhancements, knows how to open device objects, and\nwill let you view and change object security information using native NT security editors.\n\n![screenshot](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@ab7733d9bd5714cac138fe9e5eec447633fb3d75/automatic/winobj/screenshot.png)\n\n## Notes\n\n* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).\n  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.", "updated": "2024-03-23T21:33:37Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/winobj/3.14", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/winobj/3.14", "licenseUrl": "https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/license-terms", "packageName": "winobj", "displayName": "WinObj - Windows Sysinternals", "summary": "Object Manager namespace viewer", "version": "3.14", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dgalbraith/chocolatey-packages@4a952cb67d3ba380d5d8dc2c26f1c41270affedf/icons/winobj.png", "author": "Mark Russinovich", "downloadCount": 15116, "tags": ["object", "namespace", "object-manager", "security", "debug", "tools", "sysinternals"]}
