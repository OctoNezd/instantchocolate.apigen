These downloads were pulled in early 2014. Afterwards, Microsoft made a limited selection of downloads available on their TechBench site. Our tool is based on TechBench, and makes a range of hidden products available for download.\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/windows-iso-downloader/readme.md)**\t\n\n\t\n\n---\n\n**Click here to [Patreon-ize](https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3) the package maintainer.**\n\n---", "updated": "2024-03-23T23:33:25Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/windows-iso-downloader/8.46.0.0154", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/windows-iso-downloader/8.46.0.0154", "licenseUrl": "", "packageName": "windows-iso-downloader", "displayName": "Microsoft Windows and Office ISO Download Tool (Portable)", "summary": "Easily download Windows and Office disk images", "version": "8.46.0.0154", "icon": "https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/windows-iso-downloader/windows-iso-downloader_icon.png", "author": "Jan Krohn", "downloadCount": 17698, "tags": ["microsoft", "windows", "office", "iso"]}
