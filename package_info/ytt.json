{"description": "`ytt` (pronounced spelled out) is a templating tool that understands\n    YAML structure. It helps you easily configure complex software via reusable templates\n    and user provided values. Ytt includes the following features:\n\n- Structural templating: understands yaml structure so users can focus on their configuration instead of issues associated with text templating, such as YAML value quoting or manual template indentation\n- Built-in programming language: includes the \"fully featured\" Python-like programming language Starklark which helps ease the burden of configuring complex software through a richer set of functionality.\n- Reusable configuration: You can reuse the same configuration in different environments by applying environment-specific values.\n- Custom validations: coupled with the fast and deterministic execution, allows you to take advantage of faster feedback loops when creating and testing templates\n- Overlays: this advanced configuration helps users manage the customization required for complex software. For more, see [this example](https://get-ytt.io/#example:example-overlay-files) in the online playground.\n- Sandboxing: provides a secure, deterministic environment for execution of templates", "updated": "2024-03-22T19:03:31Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ytt/0.43.0", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ytt/0.43.0", "licenseUrl": "https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-ytt/blob/develop/LICENSE", "packageName": "ytt", "displayName": "Carvel ytt", "summary": "YAML templating tool that works on YAML structure instead of text.", "version": "0.43.0", "icon": "https://cdn.statically.io/gh/adriens/chocolatey-kbld/main/img/CarvelLogo.png", "author": "Carvel", "downloadCount": 3669, "tags": ["yaml", "template", "k8s", "k14s", "kubernetes", "devops", "cli", "foss", "vmware", "tanzu", "tkg", "docker", "helm"]}
