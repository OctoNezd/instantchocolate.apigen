{"description": "LINQPad lets you interactively query databases in a modern query language: LINQ.  LINQPad supports everything in C# 5.0 and Framework 4.x (LINQ to Objects, SQL, EF, XML, Parallel LINQ, etc.).  It also supports OData, Azure, and a lot more. LINQPad is also a great way to learn LINQ: it comes loaded with 500 examples from the book, C# 4.0 in a Nutshell.  And LINQPad is more than a LINQ tool: it's an ergonomic C#/VB/F# scratchpad that instantly executes any expression, statement block or program with rich output formatting \u2013 the ultimate in dynamic development.\n\nEnd-of-life products are no longer updated and do not support the latest protocols. In particular, the current NuGet package and feed formats are unsupported in the older versions of LINQPad.", "updated": "2024-03-13T17:49:06Z", "galleryUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/linqpad4.AnyCPU.portable/4.59", "abuseUrl": "https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/linqpad4.AnyCPU.portable/4.59", "licenseUrl": "https://www.linqpad.net/eula.txt", "packageName": "linqpad4.AnyCPU.portable", "displayName": "LINQPad 4 (Portable, AnyCPU build, End-of-Life)", "summary": "LINQPad 4 (Portable, AnyCPU build for \"massive\" queries)", "version": "4.59", "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bdukes/Chocolatey-Packages@3076028cf4247a1e2e930553372f87432768419f/linqpad/linqpadmed.png", "author": "Joseph Albahari", "downloadCount": 3818, "tags": ["linq", "sql", ".net-4", "linqpad"]}
