{"description": "Warmifier is a special audio effect AAX, AudioUnit and VST plugin for professional sound and music production applications which processes audio signal in a way similar to analog tube/valve equipment.  By using Warmifier you can achieve valve warming and \u201cconsole\u201d coloration effects.\n\nWarmifier is applicable both to the complete mixes and to the individual instrument tracks.  You have several parameters at your disposal that allow you to control the strength and the color of the effect.  Also, you have several tube/valve types to choose from.  Each valve type offers a different overall coloration.\n\nWhile the effect of this plugin is definitely subtle, the difference it makes is similar to the difference in sound between various analog mixing consoles.  In most cases it boils down to adding a subtle \u201csparkle\u201d, \u201cpresence\u201d, \u201cwarming\u201d or \u201csolidifying\u201d effect to a sound track it was applied to.\n\n## Package Specific\n\n### Package Parameters\nThe following package parameters can be set:\n\n * `/NoVst2x86`       - Do not install the x86 VST2 version\n * `/NoVst2x64`       - Do not install the x64 VST2 version\n * `/NoVst3x86`       - Do not install the x86 VST3 version\n * `/NoVst3x64`       - Do not install the x64 VST3 version\n * `/NoAaxx86`        - Do not install the x86 AAX version\n * `/NoAaxx64`        - Do not install the x64 AAX version\n * `/NoShortcuts`     - Do not install shortcuts to manuals and uninstaller into start menu or onto desktop\n * `/Vst2Path:`       - Installation path of the VST2 version\n * `/Vst2x86Path:` - Installation path of the x86 VST2 version on x64 CPU architecture\n * `/InstallerPath:`  - Do not download the installer from the official Voxengo website and use the one passed with this argument instead.
