The main motivation for developing Amaya was to provide a framework that can integrate as many W3C technologies as possible. It is used to demonstrate these technologies in action while taking advantage of their combination in a single, consistent environment.\n\nAmaya started as an HTML + CSS style sheets editor.

simply selecting the node and dropping it on the content control you wish to map to.\nThe editor allows you to also edit/add/remove Custom XML parts and manipulate content control properties.\nThe tool does not require Word to be installed because it operates directly on the new Open XML file formats by reading and writing to them using the System.IO.Packaging library available in .NET.\nThe
